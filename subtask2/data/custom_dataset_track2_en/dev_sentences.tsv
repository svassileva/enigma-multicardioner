"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia129	51	4013	The patient had a torpid evolution with heart failure that was difficult to manage and systemic embolisation despite anticoagulation, so in view of this clinical picture and given the findings described (anterior AMI evolved with apical aneurysm and thrombus inside, together with doubtful rupture of the LV wall with some associated pericardial effusion), cardiac surgery was consulted and surgery was scheduled.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia13	11	1063	Paraclinical tests showed normocytic normochromic anaemia (haemoglobin: 9g/dl) associated with thrombocytopenia (100,000/mm3), hypoalbuminaemia (3g/dl), microscopic haematuria, proteinuria and renal failure (creatinine: 1.6mg/dl), which led to glomerulonephritis; in addition, the chest X-ray and later a chest CT scan ruled out not only pulmonary infection, but also lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly, although they showed signs of pulmonary congestion.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia13	12	1523	"Subsequently, the patient underwent transesophageal echocardiography, which showed: prolapse of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve, with severe insufficiency and an image of 2.1Ã1.1cm in the distal third, compatible with endocardial vegetation.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia13	14	2169	"Based on the modified Duke criteria1 , a diagnosis of infective endocarditis was made, meeting one major criterion (presence of vegetation on echocardiography) and four minor criteria (predisposing cardiac condition, fever, glomerulonephritis and positive blood cultures of a germ that did not meet the characteristics of the major criterion).

"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia13	15	2514	Because the patient had severe mitral insufficiency with signs and symptoms of heart failure, and the size of the vegetation was greater than 15mm, transfer to surgery for mitral valve replacement (biological valve) was considered.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia13	16	2746	It should be noted that despite being a young patient, biological valve implantation was decided because the patient's social conditions (severe mental retardation and living in a rural area) made it very difficult for him to travel to attend anticoagulation check-ups.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia13	17	3016	Control blood cultures were performed 8 days after the start of antibiotic therapy with no microbiological growth, and antibiotic treatment was completed with ampicillin sulbactam adjusted according to the sensitivity profile for up to 28 days, in accordance with the recommendation of the guidelines for the treatment of streptococcus.

"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia134	39	4005	During his stay in the ED, CT angiography was performed to rule out acute aortic syndrome given the patient's presentation with hypertensive emergency, stabbing pain and troponin elevation.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia134	40	4195	The CT angiography was reported as normal, so the patient was admitted to cardiology to study chest pain with elevated markers of myocardial necrosis and heart failure.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia134	41	4364	On the second day of admission to cardiology, the patient presented a fever peak of 38.5o, with no apparent infectious focus (neither clinically nor in complementary tests), and with negative blood cultures.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia134	42	4572	Given the presence of moderate-severe aortic insufficiency in the transthoracic echocardiogram, a transesophageal study was performed on suspicion of endocarditis as a possible aetiology of the clinical picture.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia134	43	4784	"The patient's clinical condition meant that he did not tolerate the procedure adequately, and although no clear signs of endocarditis were observed, the study was of poor quality and was stopped early.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia134	44	4986	In the following days, the patient does not present fever or infectious symptoms again.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia134	45	5074	There were no new episodes of chest pain; however, in the serial ECGs there was a negative T-wave in the anterior face, so a stress cardiac MRI was requested to assess the presence of necrosis or inducible ischaemia.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia134	46	5291	"The MRI was negative, ruling out signs of myocarditis or myocardial necrosis, but aortic insufficiency of severe appearance was again observed.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia134	47	5435	However, given that the patient continued to present progressive elevation of troponin and the electrical changes persisted (deepening of the T wave on the lateral side), a diagnostic cardiac catheterisation was requested, which showed a non-significant lesion in the RCA and confirmed the severity of the aortic insufficiency.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia134	48	5763	On the 5th day of admission, the patient presented a new febrile peak of 38o, and an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation with failed pharmacological and electrical cardioversion, in the context of mild decompensation of heart failure.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia134	49	5999	Once again, a battery of tests was requested to rule out infection, which was ruled out, with negative blood cultures again.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia134	50	6124	On the 7th day of admission to Cardiology, he presented an episode of desaturation, tachypnoea and hypotension, compatible with acute pulmonary oedema, for which he was admitted to the Coronary Unit and finally required orotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, as well as inotropic support with vasoactive drugs.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia134	51	6447	A transesophageal echocardiogram was performed with the patient intubated, ruling out endocarditis, and finally a localised dissection of the aortic root responsible for the severe aortic insufficiency was observed, and Cardiovascular Surgery was contacted for urgent intervention.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia134	52	6729	"Intraoperatively, a type A dissection was observed, with circumferential intimal rupture at the level of the sinotubular junction causing sagging of all the commissures, this being the mechanism of the aortic insufficiency observed.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia136	69	7438	Given the coexistence of both entities and the initial clinical and haemodynamic stability of the patient, it was decided to manage the patient conservatively at first, trying to resolve the heart failure data and see the evolution of the pulmonary arterial pathology, as there was a limitation in the use of anticoagulation at recommended doses in the presence of aortic dissection.

This is a patient with repeated admissions for haemoptysis with migratory pulmonary infiltrates and examination data suggestive of decompensation of heart failure, as well as elevated natriuretic peptide levels, with good clinical-radiological evolution in the various admissions with diuretic treatment."
casos_clinicos_cardiologia169	76	6074	The complementary tests performed were suggestive of alveolar haemorrhage (although the bronchoscopy showed no evidence of active bleeding, it was performed in a stable clinical situation after resolution of the haemoptysis, showing haemosiderin-laden macrophages with no evidence of active infection), the substrate of which seems to be decompensation of heart failure in the context of severe aortic stenosis.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia169	77	6486	In view of these findings, the case was discussed with cardiology, and the case was presented at a medical-surgical session, and a decision was made to replace the aortic valve.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia169	78	6664	Given the EuroScore of 7.3%, percutaneous replacement by femoral access was initially considered, but was ruled out after angiography in which inadequate aorto-iliac axes were observed.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia169	79	6850	For this reason, it was decided to implant the prosthesis via transapical access.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia169	80	6932	On 24/02/2015, a 23 mm Edwards SAPIEN 3 biological prosthesis was implanted under echocardiographic monitoring.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia169	82	7164	He remained in the CICU for 48 hours with good clinical evolution, requiring transfusion of three red blood cell concentrates and slight deterioration of renal function, and was transferred to the cardiac surgery ward.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia169	83	7383	During his stay on the cardiac surgery ward he evolved favourably without complications and was discharged after 7 days.

The patient is a 76-year-old woman admitted with acute pulmonary oedema."
casos_clinicos_cardiologia170	58	3974	Emergent TTE was performed and showed a moderately affected left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) with severe aortic stenosis and insufficiency secondary to dysfunction of the mechanical aortic valve prosthesis.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia170	59	4190	Given his history of previous surgery with under-therapeutic doses of anticoagulation, acute-subacute prosthetic thrombosis was suspected on admission as the main aetiology.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia170	60	4364	"For this reason, a TEE study was completed which led to this diagnosis.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia170	61	4436	Medical treatment was started with intravenous diuretics.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia170	62	4494	The patient evolved unfavourably and was haemodynamically unstable, requiring vasoactive support, so given the situation of cardiogenic shock, emergency aortic valve replacement surgery was decided.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia170	63	4693	Emergent surgery was performed, in which a St Jude aortic prosthesis no 19 blocked by the presence of two small clots of less than 5 mm in both hinges was visualised.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia170	64	4860	The prosthesis was explanted and the annulus was enlarged with a pericardial patch in the non-coronary leaflet towards the mitral annulus in order to implant the Magna Ease No 19 biological prosthesis.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia170	65	5062	He presented with an episode of ventricular fibrillation that reverted after defibrillation, so it was decided to re-enter CPB and implant intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation (IABP) via the right femoral artery with insufficient haemodynamic response and severe left ventricular dysfunction; finally it was decided to implant a peripheral femoro-femoral venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenator (ECMO).

casos_clinicos_cardiologia172	1	0	"HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
We present the case of a 54-year-old woman from Paraguay."
casos_clinicos_cardiologia172	2	108	She had a history of arterial hypertension treated with diuretics and a probable episode of pulmonary embolism for which she had received anticoagulant treatment in 2013, which the patient described imprecisely.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia172	3	320	She remained asymptomatic after this episode.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia172	4	366	"However, 4 months prior to the current admission, she began to present symptoms of progressive dyspnoea until she became resting, oedema in the lower limbs and a weight loss of 10 kg, for which reason she consulted a cardiologist in Paraguay.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia172	5	609	A transthoracic echocardiogram showed moderate pulmonary hypertension (PSAP 55 mmHg), severe tricuspid insufficiency (TI) and a dilated right ventricle with normal function (TAPSE 24 mm).
casos_clinicos_cardiologia172	6	797	For this reason, he was prescribed treatment with spironolactone 25 mg, furosemide 40 mg and carvedilol 12.5 mg every 12 hours.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia172	7	925	At that time, thyroid hormone tests were not performed, although they were recommended, because her health insurance did not cover such tests.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia172	8	1068	A few months later she travelled to Spain on holiday, presenting with diarrhoea for 3 days and colicky abdominal pain, for which reason she went to the emergency department of our centre.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia172	9	1256	"On arrival, he presented evident signs of heart failure, predominantly right-sided, with oedema in the legs, jugular ingurgitation and dyspnoea at rest with paradoxical breathing and supraclavicular tugging, for which the coronary unit was notified.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia172	10	1506	On admission to the coronary unit he had a blood pressure of 137/47 mmHg and heart rate of 42 bpm (in the absence of beta-blockers), temperature of 36 ÌC and oxygen saturation of 96%. Physical examination revealed marked jugular engorgement, a jugular venous pulse with oscillating stop at 5 cm from the angle of Louis and Kussmaull's sign.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia172	11	1847	In addition, a large goitre with palpable thrill and a continuous thyroid murmur, not irradiated and accompanied by bilateral exophthalmos, was documented.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia172	12	2003	"Cardiopulmonary examination revealed palpation of the right ventricle in the right parasternal region, as well as a tricuspid regurgitation murmur.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia172	13	2151	On pulmonary auscultation, the vesicular murmur was abolished in both lung bases.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia172	14	2233	The patient also showed hepatomegaly 3 cm below the costal margin and oedema with fovea up to the root of the lower limbs.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia172	15	2356	"After diuretic treatment the signs of congestion improved and bilateral pretibial oedema without fovea compatible with myxoedema could be observed.

"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia172	16	2505	"COMPLEMENTARY TESTS
Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a nodal rhythm at 42 bpm, with low voltages in the limb leads and diffusely flattened T's in all leads."
casos_clinicos_cardiologia172	17	2660	Chest X-ray showed right pleural effusion, with deflected hilarity and enlarged cardiac silhouette.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia172	18	2760	At this time, an emergency portable transthoracic echocardiogram was performed showing severe right ventricular dilatation and dysfunction and severe PH (estimated PSAP of 60 mmHg), together with severe tricuspid regurgitation and evidence of peripheral congestion.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia172	19	3026	The patient was admitted under initial suspicion of chronic pulmonary embolism as the origin of the condition.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia172	20	3137	Anticoagulant and intravenous diuretic treatment was started, which resulted in large negative balances and clinical improvement.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia172	21	3267	Analyses showed anaemia (Hb 8.8 g/dl), thrombopenia (93,000 platelets/mcl), cholestasis without hepatic cytolysis (GGT 95 IU; alkaline phosphatase 223 IU, total bilirubin 1.9 mg/dl, normal GOT and GPT and spontaneous INR of 1.7), all compatible with a stasis liver.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia172	22	3533	Impaired renal function (Cr 1.7 mg/dl), hyponatraemia (Na 127) and hyperkalaemia (K 6.4), markedly elevated NT-proBNP values (11,617 pg/ml) were also documented.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia172	23	3695	"D-dimer levels were also elevated 2,400 ng/ml.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia172	24	3742	Antibody tests (ANA, rheumatoid factor, anti-glomerular basement membrane, c-ANCA and p-ANCA, anti-beta2 glycoprotein, anticardiolipin) and serology (HIV, HCV, HBV, syphilis) were also negative.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia172	25	3937	Ultrasound scans of the lower limbs and abdomen ruled out the presence of deep vein thrombosis and revealed ascites and liver stasis, respectively.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia172	26	4085	"Given the apparent chronic nature of the condition, and the deterioration of renal function, a ventilation/perfusion scan was requested (instead of CT angiography of the pulmonary arteries), with the aim of establishing the diagnosis of chronic pulmonary embolism.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia172	27	4350	The result of the test was inconclusive, so pending a definitive diagnosis, anticoagulant treatment was maintained.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia172	28	4466	Computed tomography was not performed as a first choice due to the deterioration of renal function.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia172	29	4566	Once anticoagulant and diuretic therapy had been started, we obtained the following thyroid hormone results: undetectable TSH, T3L 15.79 mlU/l and T4L 59.20 mlU/l.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia172	30	4730	Given these results, the patient was referred to the endocrinology department, who considered the condition to be primary autoimmune hyperthyroidism (Graves-Basedow disease) with secondary hypoaldosteronism and cytopenias, as the first diagnostic possibility.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia172	31	4990	Treatment was started with antithyroid drugs (thiamazole), beta-blockers (propranolol) and corticosteroids (dexamethasone).
casos_clinicos_cardiologia172	32	5114	"The results of antithyroid antibodies were positive.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia172	33	5167	During admission, the patient presented, after the first 72 hours, with a fever of 38 ÌC related to bacteraemia due to methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, which was treated with a 10-day course of antibiotherapy with cloxacillin.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia172	34	5406	After completing the course, he again developed fever and retrocardiac pulmonary infiltrate with sputum positive for Rothia mucilaginosa.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia172	35	5544	He was treated with levofloxacin, ceftriaxone and azithromycin with good response and satisfactory resolution of the infectious picture.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia172	36	5681	"Once renal function improved, a chest CT scan was performed which definitively ruled out the presence of lung embolism, highlighting the dilatation of the right heart cavities and the presence of significant right pleural effusion.

"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia172	37	5914	"CLINICAL EVOLUTION
After one month of antithyroid treatment, a repeat transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, which showed complete normalisation of both the function and size of the right ventricle."
casos_clinicos_cardiologia172	38	6118	Normalisation of pulmonary pressure and the presence of minimal tricuspid regurgitation were also documented.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia172	39	6228	The patient was finally discharged once the alterations at the right ventricular level and in the pulmonary circulation had resolved with correction of the significant thyroid disorder.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia172	40	6414	"Our patient presented a complete resolution of cardiopulmonary symptoms after normalisation of thyroid hormone levels.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia173	97	6117	"CLINICAL COURSE
A 61-year-old man with dilated cardiomyopathy of ischaemic aetiology consulted the emergency department for asthenia, anorexia, jaundice, choluria and acholia of one week's evolution, associated with thermometric fever of up to 37.9 ÌC. Analysis on arrival revealed elevated transaminases and a marked increase in the cholestasis profile with hyperbilirubinaemia at the expense of direct bilirubin, as well as leukocytosis and eosinophilia together with elevated acute phase reactants and coagulopathy, with an INR of 25, requiring the administration of 1 ampoule of vitamin K for correction.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia173	98	6726	The patient was admitted to the internal medicine department to complete the aetiological study of the condition, and all medication was withdrawn except for aspirin and clopidogrel, replacing acenocoumarol treatment with enoxaparin.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia173	99	6960	To this end, serology for hepatotropic viruses, determination of parasites in faeces and immunology tests were carried out, all of which were negative.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia173	100	7112	Imaging studies were also carried out by abdominal ultrasound and cholangio-MRI, which only revealed the presence of lymphadenopathies in the hepatic hilar and celiac region, without content or dilatation at the level of the biliary tree.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia173	101	7351	Having ruled out an infectious, autoimmune or obstructive aetiology, a systematic review of the literature was carried out and cases of idiosyncratic hepatitis secondary to the administration of statins were found.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia173	102	7566	"The allergology and gastroenterology departments were consulted and confirmed the diagnosis of suspected idiosyncratic hepatitis, recommending definitive discontinuation of statin treatment and reintroduction of the rest of the treatment that had been withdrawn on admission.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia173	103	7842	With regard to the subsequent evolution, the patient presented a resolution of the cytolysis profile and normalisation of eosinophilia within 8 days of withdrawal of atorvastatin; he persisted with a discrete elevation of the cholestasis pattern at discharge.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia173	104	8102	Clinically, the patient experienced a marked improvement, with resolution of abdominal symptoms, as well as resolution of choluria and acholia.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia173	105	8246	In relation to the above, and given that the patient had high LDL cholesterol levels (LDL 174 mg/dl), he was referred to the lipid unit of our centre in order to consider the use of PCSK9 inhibitors, and was assessed 1 month later, with transaminase and cytolysis enzyme levels within normal limits in control analyses.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia173	106	8566	From the cardiovascular point of view, a control echocardiogram and magnetic resonance imaging were performed during admission, showing persistent severe left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF 25%), with anteroseptal akinesia and apical aneurysm.

"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia178	27	2738	"CLINICAL EVOLUTION
Given a severe haemolytic anaemia in a patient with a metallic valve prosthesis without any other cause, a transesophageal echocardiogram was requested which confirmed a de novo perivalvular leak with associated moderate mitral insufficiency."
casos_clinicos_cardiologia178	28	3000	Due to the appearance of a new paravalvular leak, a PET-CT scan was performed in search of an aetiology, showing perivalvular uptake suggestive of infective endocarditis.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia178	29	3171	Although the patient was afebrile throughout admission and all blood cultures were negative without having received previous antibiotic treatment, he had high titres of Coxiella IgG, so antibiotic treatment was started with ceftriaxone for 6 weeks and doxycycline for 18 months.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia178	30	3450	Six weeks after starting the antibiotic regimen, a new PET-CT scan was performed, which no longer showed mitral uptake.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia178	31	3570	Treatment with erythropoietin and folic acid was also started to treat the haemolytic anaemia.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia178	32	3665	Despite the resolution of the infectious condition, asthenia and anaemia persisted in the context of valve dysfunction, so it was decided to intervene on the valve.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia178	33	3830	Due to the high surgical risk of open surgery, increased by the patient's refusal to use blood transfusions and blood products, it was finally decided to proceed with percutaneous closure of the paravalvular leak.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia207	46	6068	However, the implantation of the device was rejected for various reasons: the presence of left ventricular dysfunction that made the risk of the surgical intervention that the patient needed to cure her unacceptable at that time; the risk of new dissemination or rupture of cysts with the manipulation of lines and cannulas in the venous territory, and the complexity of the management of assistance in a patient with severe pulmonary circulation alteration.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia207	47	6527	"In this context, expectant management was decided, awaiting spontaneous recovery to reactivate the initial plan.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia207	48	6640	During the hours immediately after the episode, the patient showed discrete haemodynamic improvement that allowed suspension of adrenaline perfusion and a decrease in noradrenaline to 0.2 Î¼g/kg/min with progressive improvement of the distal hypoperfusion data.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia207	49	6901	Under low doses of dobutamine, a new echocardiogram was performed where severe left ventricular dysfunction persisted.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia207	51	7129	"However, 24 hours after the anaphylactic shock episode, she presented a sudden episode of desaturation, with associated hypotension and spontaneous recovery after starting support with high-flow glasses with FiO2 of 1, with data compatible with pulmonary congestion on chest X-ray.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia207	52	7411	Hours later, he presented with frank haemodynamic deterioration, with associated episodes of desaturation and urticaria suggesting a new case of anaphylaxis, probably due to the release of hydatid vesicles.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia207	53	7618	Initially, doses of vasoactive drugs were increased, intramuscular adrenaline and bolus corticotherapy were started, despite which she presented with new haemodynamic deterioration, with moderate-severe dilatation of the right ventricle on urgent echocardiography, maintaining severe left ventricular dysfunction.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia207	54	7932	The patient presented with a new episode of desaturation, associated urticaria and loss of consciousness that required orotracheal intubation, after which electromechanical dissociation was observed, which could not be reversed after 25 minutes of advanced CPR manoeuvres.

Continuing with the study of the left ventricular dysfunction detected at the outpatient level, cardiac MRI was performed 3 weeks after the consultation, showing improvement in ventricular function, with moderate dysfunction, and catheterisation was performed (due to the late gadolinium enhancement image suggestive of necrosis), which showed no significant angiographic lesions.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia218	63	7968	"A directed anamnesis was performed, in which a significant history of enolism and exposure to toxins, previous chest pain or angina pectoris, and data suspicious of myocarditis were ruled out.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia218	64	8161	Due to the characteristics of our centre and the availability of performing a catheterisation more quickly than a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, cardiac catheterisation was performed first, which revealed severe stenosis of the right coronary artery in which three drug-eluting stents were implanted.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia218	65	8467	"A cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was still to be performed at the time of discharge.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia218	66	8556	On the other hand, blood tests showed normochromic normocytic anaemia with a normal range of red blood cell distribution, but with low iron, ferritin and transferrin saturation index.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia218	67	8740	The digestive tract was ruled out as the origin of the anaemia, as there were no clinical signs to suggest this and the faecal occult blood test performed during admission was negative.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia218	68	8926	In addition, vitamin B12 and folic acid deficiency were ruled out as possible alternative causes (although the characteristics of the anaemia did not suggest this aetiology).
casos_clinicos_cardiologia218	69	9101	"The anaemia was interpreted in the context of the previous episodes of haematuria and the recent surgery, and it was decided to start treatment with intravenous iron in the form of iron carboxymaltose at an initial dose of 1000 mg, without complications during the infusion.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia218	72	9832	Approximately two months after discharge, the patient again began to show signs of congestion (he reported an increase in his baseline dyspnoea and oedema with fovea in the lower limbs) which led to an increase in oral diuretic treatment, with a good clinical response.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia218	73	10102	In addition, a control blood test showed anaemia (haemoglobin 12.6 g/dl) with a ferritin level of 49 ng/ml and a transferrin saturation index of 11.1%, without the patient reporting bleeding at any level, so it was decided to start a new course of intravenous iron carboxymaltose with the aim of improving the patient's exercise capacity and quality of life.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia226	73	4768	"CLINICAL EVOLUTION
In the history prior to admission, the patient had taken a certain amount of hypoglycaemic drugs over the previous 4 years:
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia226	74	4911	"Until 2015 the patient was taking metformin 1000 mg every 12 hours, with poor follow-up and therapeutic adherence during years of illness.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia226	75	5050	"At the end of that year, after visiting the health centre, his primary care doctor managed to recover some follow-up and associated insulin therapy: Lantus SoloStar 100 IU/ml, 30 IU in the morning, and referred him to the endocrinology department.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia226	76	5298	"In February 2016, he had an Hb1Ac of 10.8%, BMI of 40 and weight of 110 kg, eGFR of 55 ml/min/1.73 m, so the endocrinologist implemented a diabetology education course, and changed Lantus to Novomix 30/70 at 20-20-18 IU breakfast-lunch-dinner, while associating metformin/vildagliptin 50/1000 mg every 12 hours.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia226	77	5610	June 2016, insulinisation takes effect and Hb1Ac is reduced to 8.5%. BMI remains at 40.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia226	78	5698	Novomix 30 is maintained, increasing the doses to 26-26-24 IU breakfast-lunch-dinner.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia226	79	5784	"The analysis showed a GFR estimated by CDK-EPI of 40 ml/min/1.73 cm2, so it was decided to discontinue metformin/vildagliptin 50/1000 mg, maintaining only metformin 1000 mg/24 hours.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia226	80	5967	In June 2017 during admission to cardiology for an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation, associated with tachycardiomyopathy.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia226	81	6093	Hb1Ac is 7.1%.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia226	82	6108	The eGFR had decreased by 28 ml/min/1.73 m .
casos_clinicos_cardiologia226	83	6153	"Metformin was discontinued.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia226	84	6181	In February 2018 after cardiology review she had fully recovered LVEF.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia226	85	6252	Renal function had improved (eGFR 51 ml/min/1.73 m2).
casos_clinicos_cardiologia226	86	6306	Hb1Ac 8.3%. BMI was still 40.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia226	87	6336	Discussion with endocrinology, the patient's profile is optimal for starting a GLP1 analogue: diabetic with > 10 years of evolution, with metabolic syndrome, obesity (BMI > 35 kg/m2) and previous cardiovascular disease.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia226	88	6556	It was decided to start dulaglutide 0.75 mg weekly subcutaneously and progressively increased to 1.50 mg weekly, without gastrointestinal side effects, with good adaptation and tolerance to the drug.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia226	89	6756	Metformin was restarted at the same time.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia226	90	6798	"Novomix therapy was maintained.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia226	91	6830	"Six months later, the patient was reviewed and reported a weight loss of 5 kg, he was more animated, with Hb1Ac 7%. Metformin was again discontinued due to reduced glomerular filtration rate.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia226	92	7022	Returning to the current cardiology admission in 2020, the patient presented adequate clinical evolution in hospitalisation after intravenous diuretic treatment, improving from the point of view of heart failure.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia226	93	7235	A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed showing a dilated left ventricle (DTd 6.3 cm; VolTd 203 ml) with severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction (EF by Simpson bp 29%) and transmitral pattern suggestive of pseudonormalisation with high filling pressures.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia226	94	7500	Right ventricle with slightly reduced systolic function (TAPSE 15 mm).
casos_clinicos_cardiologia226	95	7571	Biauricular dilatation.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia226	96	7595	No significant valvular heart disease.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia226	97	7634	No pericardial effusion.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia226	98	7659	Coronary angiography with diffuse atheromatosis in the coronary arteries without significant lesions.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia226	99	7761	It was therefore interpreted as suggestive of a priori non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy decompensated by rapid AF, and outpatient magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was requested to complete the study.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia226	100	7965	He was treated with amiodarone 200 mg/24 hours orally, remaining in sinus rhythm, without new falls in atrial fibrillation.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia226	101	8089	In the admission blood test, Hb1Ac was 8.1%.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia226	102	8134	The BMI was 39.7.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia226	103	8152	On discharge, as this was a male with a clear metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus with poor control, the treatment was optimised as much as possible, and as an option, treatment with dulaglutide was replaced with semaglutide 0.5 mg weekly (and progressively after 4 weeks the dose was increased to 1 mg) in an attempt to improve weight loss and metabolic control, maintaining the same insulin units, as blood glucose levels during admission were in range and his HbA1c was >8%. Metformin is not associated as the glomerular filtration rate at discharge is 39 ml/min by CDK-EPI, with urine albuminuria of 146 mg/g.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia226	104	8771	"Finally, atorvastatin 40 mg/24 hours, which the patient was taking, was replaced by rosuvastatin 20 mg/24 hours.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia226	105	8884	Over the last 4 years, the patient has undergone various hypoglycaemic treatments, with frequent changes, mainly due not to side effects but to variable renal function.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia226	106	9053	The advantage of GLP1 analogues is that they are not limited by this fact.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia226	107	9128	CKD is often present in long-standing diabetic patients with poor control, since, as we know, diabetic nephropathy is one of their vascular complications.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia226	108	9283	This can lead to frequent changes in medication, which are associated with treatment errors and poorer long-term adherence of patients to medications.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia226	109	9434	"To get the most benefit from therapy, it is important to know the indications, limitations, adverse effects and to tailor the decision of which drug to prescribe to the patient's profile.

This is a patient with chronic ischaemic heart disease and a bicameral CCM, who presented progression of his angina to minimal effort angina, as well as deterioration of functional class, associated with the appearance of severe left ventricular dysfunction (previously preserved LVEF), for which it was decided to admit him to cardiology for study and treatment.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia228	101	6265	During his stay in the cardiology ward, depletive and antianginal treatment was administered, with a progressive decrease in dyspnoea, without new episodes of chest pain, tolerating ambulation.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia228	102	6459	Coronary angiography showed progression of the non-revascularisable coronary artery disease, so it was decided to optimise the antianginal and heart failure medical treatment.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia228	103	6635	Spironolactone and sacubitril/valsartan were started without incident.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia228	104	6706	Given the presence of poorly controlled diabetes associated with obesity and difficult-to-control hypertension in a patient with ischaemic heart disease and heart failure, it was decided to add liraglutide 0.6 mg daily to the treatment and the statin dose was increased.

"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia246	58	5124	"CLINICAL EVOLUTION
After admission to the cardiology ward, the patient initially evolved favourably, but subsequently presented clinical deterioration due to a new increase in dyspnoea associated with a marked decrease in the volume of diuresis (< 10 ml/kg/h) and hypotension (BP 73/35 mmHg), so that in view of the situation of cardiogenic shock it was decided to admit her to the coronary unit for stabilisation.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia246	59	5539	"Vasoactive support was started with noradrenaline at 12 mcg/min and inotropic support with dobutamine at 10 mcg/kg/min, as well as intensive diuretic therapy with iv perfusion of furosemide at 20 mg/h, with an initial favourable response that allowed negative balances to be maintained without the need to start ultrafiltration therapy.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia246	60	5876	"The echocardiographic study confirmed the presence of severe ventricular dysfunction and severe aortic stenosis (and moderate aortic regurgitation) and diagnostic coronary angiography detected severe two-vessel coronary artery disease, as well as significant calcification of the ascending aorta, which was confirmed by non-contrast thoracic CT.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia246	61	6222	"With these findings, the case was presented at the medical-surgical session, and surgical valve replacement by the HEART Team was rejected given the patient's clinical situation, with an excessive surgical risk (EuroSCORE II 80.35%), as well as her anatomical characteristics, with very marked aortic calcification that unacceptably limited the possibilities of cannulation for extracorporeal circulation.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia246	62	6628	"In addition, given the presence of at least moderate aortic regurgitation, aortic balloon valvuloplasty as a bridge to TAVI was ruled out and it was decided to initially stabilise the patient in the OCU and, depending on the evolution, to consider two-stage treatment with percutaneous revascularisation of the coronary lesions and subsequent percutaneous aortic valve replacement.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia246	63	7010	"During his stay in the OCU, the evolution was slowly favourable and, after treatment with IV levosinendan, inotropic support could be withdrawn, requiring only vasopressor support with low doses (0.1 - 0.2 mcg/kg/min) of NA. Percutaneous revascularisation of the AD and DC lesions was performed.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia246	64	7306	"Finally, percutaneous valve replacement via the right femoral artery was attempted, and after expansion of the bioprosthesis, the patient presented cardiac arrest due to electromechanical dissociation, with no immediate complications derived from the technique (coronary occlusion, pericardial contrast extravasation, aortic rupture, or prosthetic embolisation), so advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation manoeuvres were started, resulting in exitus after 40 min without achieving recovery of spontaneous circulation.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia247	78	6382	"CLINICAL EVOLUTION
This is a patient under cardiological follow-up for his valvular heart disease, consisting of severe mitral insufficiency, who was referred to our clinic preferentially due to worsening functional class and recent admission for heart failure."
casos_clinicos_cardiologia247	79	6644	At this time, mitral valve treatment is being considered.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia247	80	6702	"Taking into account the patient's comorbidities (moderate surgical risk, EuroSCORE II 4.46%) and history of pulmonary resection with severe chronic lung disease, he was considered the best candidate for percutaneous mitral valve treatment.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia247	81	6942	Thus, the patient is admitted on a scheduled basis for the procedure.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia247	82	7012	It is performed in the cath lab under general anaesthesia and monitored by transesophageal echocardiography.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia247	83	7121	Two mitral clips are released with reduction of the mitral regurgitation grade to mild-moderate (grade II/IV), maintaining a good opening area without significant increase in valve gradients (mean gradients of 3 mmHg).
casos_clinicos_cardiologia247	84	7340	The procedure was terminated, but when the catheter was removed, the patient presented significant desaturation with hypoxaemia in the arterial blood gas analysis, with the rest of the vital signs remaining stable.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia247	85	7555	The transesophageal echocardiogram showed that the mitral clips had not embolised, biventricular systolic function was good and there was no pericardial effusion.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia247	86	7718	However, a significant right-to-left Doppler flow was observed at the level of the atrial septal defect secondary to the transseptal puncture.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia247	87	7861	The decrease in left atrial pressure as the degree of mitral regurgitation decreased, together with the very high right atrial pressures due to severe pulmonary hypertension and tricuspid regurgitation, explains this phenomenon.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia247	88	8090	Since the patient persisted with hypoxaemia despite 100% oxygen concentrations on the ventilator, it was decided to percutaneously close the atrial septal defect with an Amplatzer device.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia247	89	8278	"The patient's oxygenation improved and he was transferred to the post-surgical critical care unit where he was extubated without incident.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia247	90	8417	In the following days, the patient evolved favourably and did not present any complications at the vascular access level or deterioration of renal function or clinical signs of heart failure.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia247	91	8609	A control echocardiogram was performed which showed good placement of the mitral clips, mild to moderate insufficiency and normal gradients.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia247	92	8750	The patient was discharged from hospital on the fourth day of admission.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia247	93	8823	"On subsequent cardiology reviews, he remained clinically stable, in NYHA II/IV with mild heart failure predominantly on the right, which was controlled with a daily tablet of furosemide 40 mg.

The patient attended the emergency department where, given the presence of dyspnoea in a patient with no known heart disease, it was decided to perform a CAT scan with PET protocol, which ruled out the presence of pulmonary thromboembolism but revealed a striking mass in the left atrium, for which reason cardiology was consulted and admitted to his care as the debut of heart failure.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia252	33	3956	Based on the CT scan findings and pathological auscultation, with a clear clinical suspicion, a transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiogram was performed which showed the presence of a giant pedunculated mass in the left atrium compatible with a myxoma which, in diastole, protruded into the left ventricle causing significant mitral stenosis.

The patient was initially admitted to the cardiology ward with depletive and disease-modifying treatment for heart failure."
casos_clinicos_cardiologia253	82	6851	In view of the constitutional syndrome, a thoracic-abdominal-pelvic CT scan was requested to rule out concomitant neoplasia.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia253	83	6976	There were no findings compatible with neoplastic disease.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia253	84	7035	"However, splenomegaly with foci of splenic infarction was noted.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia253	85	7100	In view of these findings, a repeat TTE was performed, which revealed, in addition to the ventricular dysfunction already observed in the study performed in the previous 3 weeks, a large mobile mass in the pulmonary valve and moderate mitral insufficiency on a valve with a small mass compatible with endocarditis.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia253	86	7415	"Transesophageal echocardiography was performed, confirming the diagnosis, so serial blood cultures were taken and empirical antibiotic therapy was started with vancomycin (20 mg/kg/12 hours i.v.) and gentamicin (3 mg/kg/day i.v.).
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia253	87	7646	In the first days of admission, the patient remained very symptomatic, with dyspnoea on minimal exertion and episodes of sudden dyspnoea, although afebrile.

"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia253	89	7892	The case was discussed at a medical-surgical session and scheduled for surgery.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia253	90	7972	"However, the patient evolved unfavourably, presenting an episode of acute pulmonary oedema and requiring transfer to the coronary unit for stabilisation.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia253	91	8126	Progressive blood tests showed significant anaemisation, with a drop to 8 g/dl, requiring transfusion given the clinical condition.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia253	92	8258	In addition, severe neutropenia and thrombopenia were observed (nadir of 100 cells/Î¼l and 31000/l, respectively).
casos_clinicos_cardiologia253	93	8372	Because of this, it was decided to postpone surgery.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia253	94	8425	"He was assessed by haematology, started on treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF), and a bone marrow aspirate was performed.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia253	95	8573	Due to neutropenia, meropenem 1g/8h i.v. was added to the treatment, with the appearance of a generalised maculopapular rash that forced its interruption.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia253	96	8728	"Meanwhile, the result of the aspirate showed no pathological findings, so it was considered that the origin of the haematological alteration could be drug-related, and it was decided to replace vancomycin with daptomycin (10 mg/kg/day i.v.).
"

casos_clinicos_cardiologia253	100	9348	Serology and even autoimmunity tests were performed, all of which were negative and the microorganism responsible could not be identified.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia253	101	9487	"Nuclear medicine tests were considered in view of the lack of an aetiological diagnosis; however, given the patient's clinical situation, they were not carried out.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia253	102	9652	Finally, clinical stability was achieved, and surgery was performed to replace the mitral and pulmonary valves with biological prostheses.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia253	103	9791	In addition, the pacemaker lead and generator were removed and epicardial leads were implanted in the AD, RV and LV for resynchronisation, with placement of a new generator in the right abdominal subcostal region.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia253	104	10005	Bypass over the LAD was ruled out as the vessel could not be adequately exposed due to the presence of abundant epicardial fat, so percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) over the LAD will be performed at a later date.

"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia254	83	7402	"At that time, we considered several differential diagnoses: inferolateral ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (STEMI), pericarditis, myopericarditis, tako-tsubo syndrome or a mixed picture.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia254	84	7601	"The decision was made to activate the haemodynamics unit to perform an emergent coronary angiography, which did not show coronary lesions that would justify the current picture, so the picture was initially interpreted as a tako-tsubo syndrome that would justify the elevation of the markers of myocardial damage together with the alterations in segmental contractility and associated pericarditis.

"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia260	129	10115	"In the absence of response to initial emergency measures, the patient was admitted to the ICU in cardiogenic shock requiring support with vasoactive drugs (dobutamine and noradrenaline).
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia260	130	10302	On admission, an urgent echocardiogram was performed showing severe biventricular systolic dysfunction (LVEF 15%) with severe secondary mitral regurgitation and an apical ventricular thrombus, for which anticoagulation with enoxaparin was initiated and levosimendan perfusion was started.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia260	131	10591	An emergency coronary angiography ruled out coronary artery disease and the patient was labelled cardiogenic shock in the context of probable acute myocarditis.

"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia260	135	11171	During the following 7-10 days the patient remained stationary, dependent on vasoactive drugs (VAD), with persistently elevated troponins and BNP levels (although slightly decreasing) and no improvement in cardiac ventricular function.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia260	136	11407	"During her admission to the ICU she was also assessed by angiology, who considered it necessary to perform a metatarsophalangeal amputation of the second-fourth MII phalanges in a few weeks, due to necrosis of the same, probably secondary to low cardiac output, high doses of VAD and ventricular thrombus embolism.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia260	137	11722	Given the suspicion of myocarditis with a possible infectious aetiology due to the data of severe global dysfunction and elevated cardiac markers and acute phase reactants, serological tests were requested, with positive liver virus C, as well as IgG and IgM against cytomegalovirus and IgG against Epstein-Barr virus, and the rest of the tests were negative.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia260	138	12082	Blood cultures were requested and were negative.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia260	140	12242	After a month of admission to the coronary unit, with slow but progressive improvement, remaining haemodynamically stable after withdrawal of vasoactive drugs, she was finally transferred to the hospital ward.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia260	141	12452	A new echocardiogram was performed which showed an improvement in biventricular function (LVEF 41%), with no intraventricular thrombus visible.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia260	142	12596	At the myocardial level, slight concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle was observed, which appeared hyperechogenic and with a reduced ventricular cavity size and data of advanced diastolic dysfunction with increased filling pressures and left atrial size, with no other valvular alterations other than the aforementioned mitral insufficiency.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia260	143	12945	"The data were suggestive of deposit or infiltrative disease, with an inflammatory/viral origin being less likely.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia260	144	13059	"Given these findings, an extensive aetiological study was continued, ruling out autoimmune diseases (negative autoantibody battery) and prothrombotic diseases (special coagulation study with heterozygosity for mutation in the gene for factor XII, methyltetrahydrofolate reductase and factor V Leiden).
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia260	145	13361	For the study of possible infiltrative disease, cardiac amyloidosis, both AA, AL and by transthyretin (TTR), was the first study target.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia260	146	13498	Urine proteinogram and urine light chains were negative, and a rectal and subcutaneous fat biopsy with Congo red staining were negative.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia260	147	13635	To rule out familial or senile transthyretin amyloidosis, a technetium-99 diphosphonate scan was performed, which did not identify abnormal TTR deposits.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia260	148	13789	For the study of possible cardiac sarcoidosis, a whole-body PET-CT scan with 18 fluorodeoxyglucose was performed, which showed a diffuse, homogeneous circumferential uptake in the entire left ventricular myocardium, suggestive of deposit disease rather than inflammatory, but not compatible with the typical cardiac involvement of sarcoidosis, which is usually patchy.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia260	149	14158	"A blood test ruled out the presence of haemochromatosis (normal ferritin, transferrin and transferrin saturation index), as well as Wilson's disease and Fabry's disease.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia260	150	14328	"The patient was discharged in good functional class, after more than 2 months of hospitalisation, with a diagnosis of cardiomyopathy of unaffiliated origin, and reviewed in consultation every three months.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia260	151	14534	"Initially she presented clinical and analytical improvement; however, from the eighth month after discharge, there was a progressive worsening with an increase in BNP and troponin, as well as a decrease in LVEF and the need for a new admission due to recurrence of the intraventricular thrombus.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia260	152	14830	"For this reason, treatment was started with apixaban 5 mg every 12 hours and diuretic and heart failure treatment was optimised.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia260	153	14959	After discharge from hospital, the patient was referred to the outpatient clinic for family heart disease in order to clarify whether she might have a cardiomyopathy of this type.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia260	154	15139	On closer examination, the patient's short stature (126 cm), the presence of sensorineural hearing loss and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW) were noted, leading to the suspicion of mitochondrial MELAS disease.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia260	155	15353	"A genetic study was then requested to confirm this and indeed it showed an m.3243A>G mutation in the MT-TL1 gene, with heteroplasmy of 13% in peripheral blood, this being the variant most frequently associated with mitochondrial diseases, and in particular with MELAS syndrome (mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes).
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia260	156	15704	In order to demonstrate a greater degree of heteroplasmy at the myocardial level and the possible association of myocarditis as a possible trigger for such a marked worsening of cardiac function, an endomyocardial biopsy was performed, which confirmed this suspicion.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia27	3	755	Three weeks before admission, pain with the same characteristics migrated to the left ankle and became bilateral and symmetrical, and did not subside with common analgesics.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia27	4	929	Two weeks before admission, due to the persistence of the symptoms, she consulted a doctor who requested complementary studies and found a sudden drop in haemoglobin levels, and indicated referral to the Haematology Department.Two days before admission to the department, the symptoms (arthralgias, fever and dyspnoea) were exacerbated and the patient went to the emergency department where she was assessed by a haematologist who requested additional tests.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia27	5	1388	Subsequently, the patient was admitted to the ward with the following laboratory results.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia27	6	1478	Data of value on physical examination were: On ectoscopy, dyspnoeic fascies, pallor of skin and mucous membranes; in the respiratory system, poor respiratory mechanics, tachypnoea, dyspnoea, on percussion, dullness in both bases, on auscultation, subcrepitant in both midfields, abolished in both bases; in the cardiovascular system, heart sounds with regular rhythm, tachycardia, R1 and R2 hypophonetic, no galloping, diastolic murmur in aortic focus and holosystolic in mitral focus with irradiation to the axilla; abdomen soft, depressible, not painful, slight splenomegaly, no palpable hepatomegaly; in the osteoarticular system, inflammatory signs at the level of the right knee.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia27	9	2393	In the following days the patient presented febrile peaks and polycultures were performed.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia27	10	2484	A volume of concentrated red blood cells was transfused and the patient's dyspnoea worsened, having previously returned a negative direct Coombs' test.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia27	11	2636	A simple CT scan of the chest showed a diffuse interstitial pattern with bilateral pleural effusion in both bases, and so, with the possibility of collagenopathy, boluses of methylprednisolone (5 grams) were started, to which she responded favourably.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia27	12	2888	Rheumatological profiles were requested (ANA, anti DNA, anti CCP, C3, C4, Anti B2 glycoprotein, Antiphospholipid, Anticardiolipin, Lupus anticoagulant, Antithrombin III, Prot.C and S) which all returned in the normal range except FR in dilution 1/512.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia27	13	3140	A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, showing vegetation on the aortic and mitral valves, with pseudoaneurysm of one aortic and one mitral leaflet, as well as perforation of one aortic leaflet, which led to a diagnosis of endocarditis and empirical antibiotic therapy was started immediately, even though the laboratory tests returned with few variations.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia27	14	3504	Days later, blood cultures returned positive for Streptococcus alpha haemolyticus in 3 of 8 bottles.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia270	60	4127	"CLINICAL EVOLUTION
Initially, under the diagnosis of heart failure probably related to anaemia, the patient was transfused with red blood cell concentrate and depletive treatment was started, with substantial clinical improvement."
casos_clinicos_cardiologia270	61	4358	However, although the patient's dyspnoea and non-productive cough could be attributed to his decompensation of heart failure, given the current epidemiological context, especially with the febrile peak, it was imperative to rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the patient was transferred to the COVID-19 hospital and treatment with hydroxychloroquine was initiated.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia270	62	4723	"Two negative nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained, which, together with the positivity in the two sets of blood cultures for E. faecium, made it possible to reasonably rule out the diagnosis of coronavirus infection and direct the focus towards a diagnosis of heart failure in the context of infective endocarditis and exacerbation of chronic anaemia.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia270	63	5073	He was therefore transferred from the internal medicine ward of COVID-19 to the cardiology ward, starting empirical antibiotherapy with daptomycin at the time of positive blood cultures.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia270	64	5260	"Once the antibiogram was known, it was decided to extend coverage by adding ampicillin and gentamicin.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia270	65	5363	The case was presented to the cardiac surgery department, who accepted the patient for intervention.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia270	66	5464	A brain MRI was performed which ruled out significant neurological complications.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia270	67	5546	However, it was decided to take another exudate for SARS-CoV-2 PCR as a precautionary measure, and the result was positive.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia270	68	5670	The patient was therefore transferred back to the COVID-19 internal medicine hospital for medical treatment until the nasopharyngeal exudate was negative, with the option of urgent surgery in the event of worsening resistant to medical treatment.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia270	69	5917	"The patient remained for several days with persistent fever and progressive clinical deterioration, with dyspnoea on minimal effort, intense orthopnoea that forced him to sleep sitting up and several episodes of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, requiring oxygen therapy with a reservoir, so that finally, taking into account the risk/benefit balance, it was decided to intervene, performing a double valve replacement with mechanical prostheses.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia270	70	6361	After surgery, the patient was transferred to intensive care, where he experienced a torpid initial evolution, developing mixed cardiogenic and vasoplegic shock in relation to extracorporeal circulation, requiring orotracheal intubation and support with dobutamine and noradrenaline.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia270	71	6645	"Echocardioscopy showed volume depletion and moderate deterioration of left ventricular contractility, with a favourable response to levosimendan.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia274	39	3020	"CLINICAL EVOLUTION
Given the presence of pseudoaneurysm contained in the valved tube, it was decided to perform repair surgery."
casos_clinicos_cardiologia274	40	3148	Prior to surgery, a transeophageal echocardiogram was performed to confirm the severity of the MR, coronary artery catheterisation was also performed, which ruled out the presence of lesions, and the presence of double lumen in the valved tube was confirmed by aortography.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia274	41	3422	"It was jointly decided that as the patient was going to undergo cardiac surgery, he would benefit from mitral valvuloplasty with a ring.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia274	42	3559	Surgery was performed with hypothermic arrest at 18o given the high risk of rupture of the pseudoaneurysm when performing the sternotomy.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia274	43	3697	The pseudoaneurysm was confirmed with an entry port at the anastomosis of the valved tube with the aortic root.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia274	44	3809	It is completely removed and replaced with a biological valved tube.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia274	45	3878	Ring annuloplasty is also performed.

After being assessed by the cardiology team, it was decided to transfer her to the acute cardiac care unit for close monitoring, where she presented poor initial evolution with criteria of cardiogenic shock, both clinical and analytical, so inotropic and vasoactive support treatment was started."
casos_clinicos_cardiologia275	52	3862	"An endomyocardial biopsy was performed, confirming the diagnosis of lymphocytic myocarditis, and it was decided to administer intravenous corticosteroids (three doses of methylprednisolone).
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia275	53	4053	In the first hours of admission, the patient began with slow ventricular tachycardia with haemodynamic instability and incessant behaviour, despite treatment with intravenous antiarrhythmics and several attempts at electrical cardioversion.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia275	54	4294	It was decided by consensus with the shock team to implant an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), with subsequent peripheral veno-arterial ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) cannulation.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia275	55	4487	"The patient also required renal replacement therapy in the first days of admission due to acute renal failure.

"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia275	56	4599	After 5 days of mechanical circulatory support and in view of the favourable evolution, ECMO and IABP were gradually withdrawn.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia275	57	4727	The patient was transferred to the cardiology ward to continue her evolution and start the titration of neurohormonal medication for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia275	58	4906	"Control echocardiography at discharge showed improvement in ventricular function with moderate dysfunction and magnetic resonance imaging showed findings compatible with myocarditis.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia275	59	5089	"The patient was discharged after three weeks of admission with a diagnosis of cardiogenic shock secondary to fulminant lymphocytic myocarditis (histopathological diagnosis), but none of the serologies, multiple cultures or other samples were able to identify a specific aetiological agent.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia28	1	0	A 67-year-old woman came to the emergency department of our centre referred by her primary care physician with a one-week history of dyspnoea, orthopnoea and oedema in the lower limbs.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia28	2	185	Her personal history included arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus treated with oral antidiabetics, dyslipidaemia, permanent atrial fibrillation anticoagulated with acenocoumarol and prosthetic mitral valve replacement 6 years ago due to rheumatic stenosis with severe pulmonary hypertension.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia28	3	482	It should be mentioned that the patient had no history of known nephrourological pathology, with analytical studies prior to admission showing normal renal function, without proteinuria or sediment alterations.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia28	4	693	He was admitted to Cardiology with the diagnosis of a first episode of decompensation of heart failure, with no clear trigger.  
casos_clinicos_cardiologia28	5	821	A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed showing a normal functioning mitral prosthesis, aortic valve calcification and severe right ventricular dysfunction, with no other significant findings.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia28	6	1019	On the third day of admission he presented with a fever peak related to peripheral phlebitis, so blood cultures were taken, the IV was changed and empirical antibiotic therapy with Ceftriaxone was started.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia28	7	1225	In the following 24 hours, the growth of SAMS was confirmed in the blood cultures, and Ceftriaxone was replaced by intravenous Cloxacillin.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia28	8	1365	A transesophageal echocardiogram was performed to rule out infective endocarditis, revealing an anchored vegetative image at the level of the posterolateral mitral annulus and another, smaller, anterolateral filiform image.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia28	9	1589	In view of these findings, a diagnosis of infective endocarditis due to methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (SAMS) on the prosthetic valve was made, and Rifampicin was added to the aforementioned treatment.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia28	10	1792	The patient was assessed by the Cardiac Surgery Department and it was decided to surgically replace the prosthesis.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia28	11	1908	Since then, she has had a long and complicated postoperative period, with initial multi-organ dysfunction in the context of cardiac tamponade that required urgent reintervention.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia28	12	2087	In a situation of severe haemodynamic failure, with no evidence of sepsis and maintaining antibiotic coverage, he developed acute oligoanuric renal function deterioration attributed to hypoperfusion with the need for extra-renal depuration by continuous venovenous haemofiltration for a week.  
casos_clinicos_cardiologia28	13	2381	Urine studies performed at this time showed decreased sodium excretion (FENa < 1%) without proteinuria or sediment alterations.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia28	14	2509	In the following days, haemodynamic recovery is accompanied by a progressive increase in diuresis and improvement in renal function parameters (Crp 0.8 mg/dL), and haemofiltration can be withdrawn.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia28	15	2707	He developed multiple complications during the following months, of which the most relevant are highlighted below.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia28	16	2822	Eight weeks after the operation, he suffered an episode of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, for which an endoscopic study was carried out, revealing millimetric gastric erosions of uncertain origin.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia28	17	3021	Two weeks later, non-pruritic raised petechiae were found on the trunk, extremities, folds and slopes.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia28	18	3124	Coinciding with the above, the urinary sediment showed proteinuria of less than 1 gram per day, with normal renal function (Crp 0.84 mg/dl).
casos_clinicos_cardiologia28	19	3265	Urgent determination of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) and anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies (anti-GBM) was requested, which were negative.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia28	20	3432	The dermatology department was consulted and a skin biopsy was taken, which was compatible with leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and treatment with Prednisone at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day was indicated.  
casos_clinicos_cardiologia28	21	3630	One week later he presented with anaemia without externalisation of bleeding and a chest X-ray showed bilateral de novo interstitial infiltrates.  
casos_clinicos_cardiologia28	22	3777	All this coincided with a new deterioration of renal function (Crp 1.78 mg/dL), oliguria, proteinuria of 850 mg/day, macroscopic haematuria and the presence of dysmorphic red blood cells and haematic and leukocyte casts in the urinary sediment.  
casos_clinicos_cardiologia28	23	4023	Given the suspicion of pulmonary haemorrhage in an anticoagulated patient, fibrobronchoscopy was performed, confirming the presence of fresh haematic debris in both bronchial trees, suggestive of alveolar haemorrhage.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia28	24	4241	Renal function progressively deteriorated, and the patient remained in a situation of oligoanuria and secondary hydrosaline overload, with persistent haematuria and proteinuria.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia28	25	4419	Given the clinical diagnosis of nephritic syndrome with pulmonary haemorrhage, an immunological study was completed, highlighting a decrease in C3 (78.8 mg/dL) and C4 (14.4 mg/dL) levels, the presence of circulating immunocomplexes and positive rheumatoid factor (190 mg/dL), with negative ANAs, antiDNA, ANCAs and antiMBG, as well as negative cryoglobulins.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia28	26	4778	The patient's respiratory condition progressively deteriorated, anticoagulation was discontinued, and it was decided to start treatment with plasmapheresis, oral cyclophosphamide (100 mg/day) and increasing the dose of prednisone (1 mg/kg/day) in view of the renopulmonary syndrome.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia28	27	5061	Prior to the start of the immunosuppressive regimen, blood cultures were taken on several occasions and were persistently negative, although all of them were removed and the patient continued with antibiotherapy.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia28	28	5274	With these measures, there was a slight improvement from the respiratory point of view, both clinically and radiologically, but the progressive deterioration of renal function persisted, again requiring extra-renal depuration by means of continuous venovenous haemofiltration.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia28	29	5551	Finally, as there was no improvement in the following days, a renal biopsy was performed with the suspicion of acute glomerulonephritis related to the infection.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia28	30	5713	The renal biopsy showed areas of increased mesangial matrix and presence of thickening in the membranes of the glomerular capillaries.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia28	31	5848	Direct immunofluorescence techniques showed granular mesangial IgA and C3 fixation, with a predominance of IgA deposits, and therefore compatible with infection-related IgA-dominant glomerulonephritis.  
casos_clinicos_cardiologia28	32	6051	In view of these findings and the extrarenal manifestations characteristic of Henoch-SchÃ¶nlein purpura, we requested an extension of the immunofluorescence of the skin biopsy, which also showed IgA deposits.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia28	33	6259	"All these findings were therefore compatible with IgA-dominant glomerulonephritis related to infective endocarditis due to SAMS with manifestations of SchÃ¶nlein-Henoch purpura (""SchÃ¶nlein-Henoch like"")."
casos_clinicos_cardiologia28	34	6462	"Despite therapeutic measures, the patient had a torpid evolution with massive alveolar haemorrhage and no recovery of renal function, finally leading to exitus.

The patient was admitted for study and treatment with the combined participation of the cardiology, internal medicine and haematology departments."
casos_clinicos_cardiologia282	55	4719	Initially, the patient showed little response to depletive treatment, with persistence of marked signs of right heart failure and systolic blood pressure around 90-100 mmHg, although without clear evidence of haemodynamic compromise.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia282	61	6569	"With the diagnosis of high-grade B lymphoma in the pericardium, it was decided not to delay chemotherapy treatment with R-CHOP/21, administering the first cycle (with Truxima) and with no immediate adverse reactions.

After the initial evaluation in the consultation room, a blood analysis was requested with parameters within normal parameters, including an NT-proBNP value of 540 pg/ml, (within normal limits for age) and an echocardiogram which showed data compatible with constrictive pericarditis that would justify the patient's clinical symptoms of asthenia.
"

casos_clinicos_cardiologia286	61	4501	Given the patient's high comorbidity and the risk of endocarditis in the event of bacteraemia due to the recent implantation of two mechanical prostheses, it was decided to start broad-spectrum antibiotherapy with ertapenem.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia286	62	4726	Two days after starting treatment with ertapenem, the patient developed generalised polyarthralgia, predominantly in the lower limbs, and non-pruritic skin lesions, which progressively worsened, some of them acquiring a bull's-eye morphology.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia286	63	4969	Suspecting toxicoderma due to ertapenem, we replaced this drug with fosfomycin, and the symptoms resolved completely within 48 hours.

Initial cardiological assessment in the emergency department revealed clinical signs of congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response at 132 bpm and left systolic dysfunction on echocardioscopy, and the patient was admitted for appropriate treatment and to complete aetiological studies.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia314	45	3856	The patient showed significant clinical improvement during the first days of admission with depletive treatment with intravenous diuretics, reaching a dry weight of 156 kg compared to the initial 171 kg.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia314	46	4060	A regulated echocardiogram was performed with echocontrast due to a poor echocardiographic window, which confirmed the echocardiographic findings, also showing elevated filling pressures with significant pulmonary hypertension and associated right-sided dysfunction.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia314	47	4327	Furthermore, the aetiological study was completed with coronary angiography to rule out ischaemic aetiology of dilated cardiomyopathy, showing no angiographically significant lesions in the epicardial coronary arteries.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia314	48	4547	"Therefore, the condition was interpreted as heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in the context of non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy, without being able to rule out a toxic origin (enolic) together with a certain component of associated tachycardiomyopathy.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia314	49	4816	"During admission, treatments with prognostic value in heart failure with depressed systolic function were successfully initiated, with good tolerance to them, achieving good heart rate control with beta-blockers at medium doses and being discharged with ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers and antialdosteronics at maximum doses tolerated by blood pressure.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia314	54	5771	"An initial strategy of rate control was proposed so that, after clinical stabilisation and one month of anticoagulation, programmed electrical cardioversion was performed for rhythm control purposes.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia314	55	5971	Regarding the choice of anticoagulation therapy at discharge, the patient refused to take VKA for personal reasons, which added to his high weight and BMI posed a major dilemma.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia314	56	6149	In agreement with the haematology service, it was decided to start rivaroxaban 20 mg and laboratory measurements of his peak and trough levels were performed to check that they were in therapeutic range.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia32	8	822	In view of the diagnosis of infective endocarditis, 3 blood cultures were taken, a serum sample was extracted for serological studies and treatment was started with diuretics, captopril, vancomycin and gentamicin.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia32	9	1036	Blood cultures remained negative after 5 days of incubation, at which point ceftriaxone was added to the previous antibiotic treatment.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia32	10	1172	Five days after admission, the patient required valve replacement surgery; the aortic valve was replaced with a mechanical prosthesis and the mitral valve was repaired.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia32	11	1341	The culture of the valve was negative and its study with a technique recently incorporated into the microbiology laboratory provided the aetiological diagnosis the day after surgery.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia32	14	1680	The patient presented with infective endocarditis with negative blood cultures.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia32	15	1760	Between 2.5% and 30% of cases of infective endocarditis have negative conventional blood cultures.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia32	16	1859	In about half of these cases the cause is antibiotic treatment prior to blood culture and in the remainder it is caused by microorganisms that are difficult to culture.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia32	17	2028	Depending on the clinical-epidemiological context, the most likely etiological agents are Coxiella burnetii, Brucella species, Bartonella species, HACEK group bacteria and to a lesser extent Tropheryma whipplei, Chlamydia species, Legionella pneumophila and others.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia32	18	2294	In this case the patient had not taken antibiotics and we should suspect microorganisms that cannot be cultured under normal conditions.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia32	19	2431	The serologies performed for Coxiella burnetii, Brucella, Bartonella, Chlamydia, Mycoplasma and L. pneumophila were negative, making it difficult to establish an aetiological diagnosis.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia32	20	2617	"Empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment and special tests were therefore necessary to reach a diagnosis.

"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia32	21	2729	Currently, the main method for the aetiological diagnosis of infective endocarditis is still blood culture.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia32	22	2837	Three blood cultures (two bottles per blood culture, aerobic and anaerobic) should be taken before antibiotic treatment is instituted.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia32	23	2972	When blood cultures are negative, serology is the most effective diagnostic method if the endocarditis is caused by C. burnetii, Bartonella and Brucella as in these cases it has a chronic course and high antibody titres are produced and a single serum is necessary.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia32	24	3238	In the case of other microorganisms such as Chlamydia, Mycoplasma and L.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia32	25	3311	"pneumophila, cross-reactions must be ruled out and their diagnostic value is lower.

"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia32	26	3396	In our case, a positive result was obtained on the same day of surgery for a universal 16S rRNA PCR performed with DNA extracted from aortic valve tissue.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia32	27	3551	The amplification product was sequenced the following day and the sequence obtained was aligned in Genebank using BLAST software (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast), presenting 100% identity with the T.

"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia32	29	3774	To confirm the diagnosis, specific PCR of the hsp65 region of T. whipplei was performed and was also positive, confirming the identity of the product obtained by sequencing.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia32	30	3948	Therefore, in case of endocarditis with negative blood cultures, a serum should be obtained for serology for the mentioned microorganisms and, if possible, the heart valve should be sent to a reference laboratory for universal PCR of the 16S rRNA gene.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia32	31	4201	"A fragment of the valve or vegetation should be sent to the anatomical pathology laboratory to confirm the diagnosis of infective endocarditis and to perform special stains: Gram, Wartin-Starry (Bartonella), PAS (T.whipplei), etc., which have high sensitivity and specificity.

Poor evolution during the first days with persistence of congestive data despite high doses of loop diuretic (furosemide 180 mg per day, in intravenous boluses), control of water intake (less than 1.5 litres per day) and controlled salt intake at meals (dose of 2 g sodium chloride per day)."
casos_clinicos_cardiologia324	71	4274	The patient presented progressive deterioration of renal function in consecutive analyses, with creatinine levels of up to 2.6 mg/dl (GFR 24 ml/min/1.73 m2).
casos_clinicos_cardiologia324	72	4432	"In view of this worsening renal function, with glomerular filtration rates below 30 ml/h, it was decided to discontinue treatment with spironolactone.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia324	73	4583	As a strategy, given that positive water balances persisted daily with worsening congestive data (third tone, increased crackles, worsening peripheral oedema), a combination diuretic strategy was decided upon.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia324	74	4793	Bolus doses of loop diuretics were discontinued and replaced by intravenous infusion of furosemide, and thiazide diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide) and carbonic anhydrase inhibitor diuretics (acetazolamide) were added to the treatment.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia324	75	5026	"Due to the history of recent prolonged hospitalisation and data of protein malnutrition, the nutrition service was contacted and protein-rich nutritional supplements were started.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia324	76	5206	Twelve hours after initiating this new treatment strategy, the patient persisted with neutral balances.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia324	77	5310	The patient presented clinical deterioration compatible with acute pulmonary oedema, which required admission to the coronary unit and ventilatory support with non-invasive mechanical ventilation.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia324	78	5507	At this point, different therapeutic options were considered.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia324	79	5569	Various pharmacological treatment options were considered, including increasing the dose of thiazide diuretics, prescribing hypertonic saline perfusion together with loop diuretic perfusion and even a more invasive strategy was considered, contacting the nephrology department to schedule haemodiafiltration sessions if necessary.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia324	80	5900	"The patient was reluctant to this last option, so it was decided to wait for a diuretic response in the following hours, adding hypertonic saline perfusion to the treatment (perfusion of 100 ml of 0.9% physiological saline with the addition of 1 ampoule of 20% ClNa).
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia324	81	6168	Finally, the patient started with a good diuretic rhythm, achieving negative water balances.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia324	82	6261	A few days later, the improvement of congestion data was evident, with improvement of pulmonary auscultation and reduction of peripheral oedema, cardiac auscultation free of third tone.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia324	83	6447	All this was accompanied by an analytical improvement in renal function, until creatinine levels before admission returned to normal.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia325	142	7865	"CLINICAL COURSE
Initially, given the hypotension observed in the emergency department, intensive serum therapy was started with little response."
casos_clinicos_cardiologia325	143	8010	Given the patient's symptoms and blood tests, the emergency department requested cardiology assessment, who performed an urgent transthoracic echocardiogram, which revealed severe left ventricular dysfunction with global hypokinesia, as well as a thin layer of pericardial effusion that did not produce echocardiographic involvement of the cavities.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia325	144	8360	Given the clinical and analytical data of haemodynamic instability (hypotension that did not respond to serum therapy, progressive distal hypoperfusion, hyperlactacidemia), it was decided to admit him to the coronary unit for monitoring and initiation of vasoactive drugs.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia325	145	8633	"Also, given the previous clinical manifestations of upper respiratory tract infection, a nasopharyngeal swab was requested for respiratory viruses (positive for influenza A virus) and empirical antimicrobial therapy was started with oseltamivir, ceftriaxone and levofloxacin, the latter to cover possible bacterial superinfection.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia325	146	8964	In the coronary unit, vasopressor support was started with noradrenaline at increasing doses and inotropic support with dobutamine, despite which the patient persisted with mean BP around 65 mmHg.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia325	147	9161	"Invasive haemodynamic monitoring by Swan-Ganz catheter showed the following initial parameters: cardiac index around 2 l/min/m2, PAPm 17 mmHg, PCP 15 mmHg, mixed venous saturation 50%. A new transthoracic echocardiogram was also performed, confirming the findings of the previous one, with a biplane Simpson LVEF of 28%, and also showing at least moderate right ventricular dysfunction with global hypokinesia and mild mitral insufficiency.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia325	148	9602	During the following 24 hours, the patient showed a poor clinical and analytical response (NT-proBNP of 18,528 pg/ml at this time) to the treatment given, with progressive worsening of haemodynamic parameters (lactic acid 6.5 mmol/l, cardiac index in decline, oliguria) despite support with dobutamine at 13 mcg/kg/min and noradrenaline at 0.35 mcg/kg/min, so it was decided to implant an intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation device.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia325	149	10037	During the balloon implantation, he presented an episode of severe hypotension with a drop in cardiac index to 1.5, requiring a significant increase in vasopressor support, with noradrenaline infusion of up to 2 mcg/kg/min, despite which lactic acid levels rose to 9.5.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia325	150	10307	"In this context, it was decided to contact cardiac surgery for urgent implantation of veno-arterial ECMO (Cardiohelp system), which was performed at the bedside without the need for orotracheal intubation (awake ECMO implantation), and the patient was transferred to the cardiac ICU for continuity of care.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia325	151	10614	During her stay in the cardiac ICU, there was a progressive improvement in haemodynamic parameters that allowed early withdrawal of noradrenaline.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia325	152	10761	A few hours later, he began to show symptoms compatible with acute ischaemia of the right lower limb, and the femoral artery was cannulated for distal perfusion, which had not been possible at first due to the urgency of the cannulation.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia325	153	10999	An endomyocardial biopsy was also performed, with no peri- or post-procedural complications and no pathological findings.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia325	154	11121	After 3 days of ECMO support, the echocardiogram showed recovery of ventricular function, so weaning was attempted under echocardiographic control.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia325	155	11269	In this context, the patient presented congestive symptoms with desaturation and worsening respiratory mechanics, without simultaneous ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography, but with a possible component of diastolic dysfunction, so it was decided not to withdraw assistance.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia325	156	11551	Chest X-ray and lung ultrasound showed a large left pleural effusion, which was drained by thoracentesis, obtaining about 1,000 ml of serous fluid.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia325	157	11699	A levosimendan infusion was also started, which was well tolerated from the haemodynamic point of view, and after 10 days of support, ECMO was withdrawn.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia325	158	11853	"In this context, he presented with significant bleeding with secondary instability, requiring polytransfusion and reinitiation of vasoactive support, but with a good evolution that also allowed the removal of the counterpulsation balloon.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia325	159	12092	Once respiratory and haemodynamic stability was achieved, she was discharged to the conventional cardiology hospital ward, where she remained asymptomatic at all times, with no arrhythmic or other events during her stay.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia325	160	12313	Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed, showing data compatible with myocarditis, as well as preserved biventricular function, and cardiac and functional rehabilitation was started with good learning and clear improvement.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia325	161	12546	"The only sequelae of the patient was a slight limitation to dorsiflexion of the right foot.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia325	162	12638	"After 21 days of total hospitalisation and being practically in her baseline condition, she was discharged home with subsequent review in cardiology consultations.

"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia328	4	268	He was initially assessed at his reference hospital for a murmur, and the echocardiogram showed a slightly dilated left ventricle (LV) with slightly depressed systolic function (LVEF) (45% according to Simpson), a myxomatous mitral valve with prolapse of both leaflets leading to mild insufficiency, a right ventricle (RV) of normal size, but with an aneurysmal and akinetic apex and depressed systolic function, and aortic root at the upper limit of normality.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia328	5	730	"In view of these findings, he was referred for specific consultation of familial heart disease for suspected arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC).
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia328	6	895	At the first visit, the patient was asymptomatic from the cardiovascular point of view.

"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia328	9	1339	"To complete the study, Holter-ECG, cardiac magnetic resonance, transesophageal echocardiogram and genetic study were performed.

"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia328	10	1468	"COMPLEMENTARY TESTS
Electrocardiogram (ECG) in consultation: sinus rhythm with incomplete right bundle branch block and a deflection from S to pseudoR > 55 ms.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia328	11	1628	"The 24-hour Holter showed ventricular extrasystoles originating from the RV outflow tract with a density of 3% (6,935 beats) and a burst of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) with RV outflow tract morphology of 11 beats, totally asymptomatic.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia328	12	1881	Cardiac MRI showed a non-dilated RV with apical hypertrabeculation with dyskinetic movement of the free and apical anterior wall, with doubtful linear fibrofatty infiltration at that level and moderately depressed right systolic function (RVEF 36%).
casos_clinicos_cardiologia328	13	2131	"The left ventricle was slightly dilated, with apical hypertrabeculation associated with lateral mid-apical hypocontractility and mildly depressed systolic function (LVEF 48%).
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia328	14	2307	"Transesophageal echocardiogram showed a myxomatous mitral valve with prolapse of both leaflets with mild insufficiency, aortic root at the high limit of normality and mild LV systolic dysfunction.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia328	15	2504	The genetic study identified him as a heterozygous carrier of a mutation in the fibrillin 1 gene associated with Marfan syndrome (NC_000015.9 mutation: g. 48737574delC), with no mutations in the genes related to arrhythmogenic RV dysplasia.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia328	16	2745	"In view of these findings and given the patient's phenotype and clinical manifestations, we diagnosed Marfan syndrome and extended the genetic study to his children, who were found to be carriers, one of whom was also affected with mild aortic dilatation.

"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia328	17	3002	"CLINICAL EVOLUTION
In view of the findings of the complementary tests and despite the fact that the genetic test for arrhythmogenic RV dysplasia was negative, we considered that the patient had this diagnosis, since he had one major criterion (anterior and apical RV dyskinesia with dysfunction < 40%) and 3 minor ones (> 500 VSD on Holter, NSVT with RV outflow tract morphology and deflection from S to pseudoR > 55 ms on the electrocardiogram).
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia328	18	3449	"Given the results of the complementary tests and the history of asymptomatic non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, it was decided to implant an automatic defibrillator (ICD) for primary prevention, in addition to medical treatment with beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors).

casos_clinicos_cardiologia33	4	276	He was agitated, his temperature was 38.3oC, cardiopulmonary auscultation was normal and he had mild ankle oedema.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia33	5	391	The most significant laboratory data were 18,700 leukocytes/mm3, 10.4 g/dL haemoglobin, plasma glucose 750 mg/dL and C-reactive protein 12.6 mg/dL. A blood culture was drawn, he was admitted with a presumptive diagnosis of hyperosmolar non-ketotic syndrome secondary to acute infection, and was treated with intravenous fluids, insulin and cefuroxime.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia33	6	743	Improvement was noted.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia33	7	766	On the third day, the clinical microbiology laboratory detected growth of small gram-negative bacilli in both blood culture bottles.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia33	8	899	One day later, rough, raised, non-hemolytic, non-hemolytic colonies of various sizes grew on the blood agar and chocolate agar plates, but not on the MacConkey agar plate.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia33	9	1071	The colonies were positive for oxidase and negative for lacatalase, indole and urease.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia33	10	1158	The isolate was identified, using the API 20E (bioMÃ©rieux) and RapIDNF Plus (Remel) systems, as Pasteurella haemolytica and reported as sensitive to cefuroxime.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia33	11	1319	The patient was re-interviewed and reported that he had a cat at home that had bitten him several times in the last month.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia33	12	1442	During the remainder of his hospitalisation the patient was afebrile but had several episodes of pulmonary congestion.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia33	13	1561	A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed moderate left ventricular dysfunction and mild mitral regurgitation.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia33	14	1676	When stabilised, he was transferred to a rehabilitation unit where he completed a 10-day course of cefuroxime.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia33	15	1787	One week later he was readmitted for increased dyspnoea and peripheral oedema.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia33	16	1866	He was treated with diuretics with minimal improvement.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia33	17	1922	He underwent a repeat TTE which this time showed significant aortic regurgitation and moderate mitral regurgitation.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia33	18	2039	Due to persistent pulmonary congestion the patient was referred to surgery for replacement of his aortic and mitral valves.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia33	19	2163	"Small vegetations on the aortic valve were observed at the operation.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia33	20	2233	Blood culture criteria require the isolation of a microorganism of the Streptococcus viridans group, Streptococcus bovis, one of the HACEK group (Haemophilus species, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenellacorrodens and Kingella species) or Staphylococcus aureus in at least 2 blood cultures taken 12 or more hours apart.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia33	21	2588	"Therefore, the collection of more than one blood culture before starting antibiotic treatment and the correct identification of blood isolates are of paramount value in the diagnosis of IE.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia33	22	2778	Valvular vegetation was cultured, but no growth was obtained; there was also no growth in the additional blood cultures taken on the second admission.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia33	23	2929	"Culture-negative endocarditis can result from the use of inadequate microbiological techniques, infection by very demanding pathogens (such as Bartonella, Brucella or Chlamydia species), or antimicrobial administration prior to blood culture collection.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia33	24	3183	In the present case, the 16S rRNA amplicon sequence of the valve tissue had >99% concordance with that of Haemophilus aphrophilus.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia33	25	3314	"Subsequently, the blood isolate previously identified as Pasteurella haemolytica was identified as H. aphrophilus.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia33	26	3429	"In the present case, the ""chain of errors"" started with insufficient inoculum to the tubes with oxidation/fermentation medium resulting in the erroneous characterisation of the isolate as ""non-fermenting"" which led to the selection of identification systems used for non-fermenting gram-negative bacteria, irrelevant in this case."
casos_clinicos_cardiologia33	27	3760	Another possible cause of confusion for clinical microbiologists is that H. aphrophilus is one of only two Haemophilus species (the other being Haemophilus ducreyi) that does not require NAD (factor V) for growth and therefore can grow on blood agar.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia33	28	4011	The genera Haemophilus and Pasteurella both belong to the same family (Pasteurelleae) and misidentification of H.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia33	29	4125	"aphrophilus as Pasteurella using commercial identification kits is well known.

"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia33	30	4205	In the present case, it is possible that correct identification and reporting of the isolate would have alerted the clinician to the possibility of IE and would have led to appropriate treatment at the first hospital admission.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia338	40	3525	"CLINICAL EVOLUTION
The patient was initially admitted to our department for heart failure with associated pericardial effusion, and diuretic treatment was started with marked clinical improvement.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia338	41	3722	"Once stable and having ruled out clinical and echocardiographic signs of cardiac tamponade and the presence of pulmonary thromboembolism by means of an angio-CT scan of the pulmonary arteries, a referral was made to the gastrointestinal department to study a diarrhoeal process secondary to possible inflammatory bowel disease and to internal medicine for a study of the general syndrome.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia338	42	4111	As part of the battery of tests performed during admission, a colonoscopy was requested in order to rule out digestive tumour pathology causing this general syndrome.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia338	43	4278	After administering the preparation for this test, the patient suffered an episode of sudden dizziness and the electrocardiogram showed the presence of complete atrioventricular block with wide QRS leakage at 40 bpm, at which time he was being treated with low-dose atenolol.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia338	44	4554	The patient was transferred to the coronary unit where a temporary electrode was implanted via the right jugular vein.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia338	45	4673	After a negative chronotropic medication washout period and verification of the absence of adequate atrioventricular conduction, a DDDR bicameral permanent pacemaker was implanted without incident.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia338	46	4871	"He had a good postoperative course and was discharged.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia338	47	4926	Given the suspicion of an infiltrative cardiomyopathy secondary to a systemic disease with involvement of several organs, the patient was assessed by the rheumatology department and the internal medicine department.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia338	48	5142	The study was completed with a CAT scan that showed a pattern in both bases suggestive of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, a spirometry that showed moderate restriction and a slight decrease in diffusion and an electromyogram in which data compatible with myopathy were observed.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia338	49	5422	In addition, a skin biopsy was performed which revealed histological findings compatible with scleroderma.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia338	50	5529	With these data, and with the persistence of episodes of self-limited diarrhoea due to a probable malabsorptive component, the diagnosis of diffuse systemic sclerosis with cutaneous, cardiac (atrioventricular block, pericardial effusion), pulmonary (interstitial pulmonary fibrosis) and digestive (malabsorption) involvement was confirmed.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia338	51	5869	Treatment with cyclophosphamide was started, with poor tolerance due to renal and bone marrow toxicity.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia338	52	5973	"Subsequently, he presented poor clinical evolution with progressive worsening of his functional class and suffered several admissions for heart failure with a predominance of congestion data refractory to diuretic treatment, and the patient died one year after diagnosis.

"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia357	55	5282	"Although the patient presents segmental contractility alterations in the transthoracic echocardiogram and multiple cardiovascular risk factors, due to renal impairment and low clinical suspicion, diagnostic catheterisation to rule out ischaemic involvement is discouraged.

In the case of the patient in question, given that he had remained stable at all times, showed no signs of heart failure and remained asymptomatic, it was decided to admit him to the ward with telemetry and treatment was started with beta-blockers (bisoprolol 2.5 mg, 1-0-1).
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia399	39	5196	Given that most VTs occur in the context of ischaemic heart disease, it seems reasonable that this was the first possibility to rule out, despite the fact that neither the clinical, analytical nor echocardiographic data corresponded to ischaemic heart disease.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia399	44	5741	"The findings could be related to myocarditis as a first possibility due to its frequency, but these enhancements are described in other less probable entities, such as sarcoidosis or Chagas disease.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia399	45	5940	The possibility of sarcoidosis was considered, since the patient had a long RP and AVBs are quite frequent in this entity.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia399	46	6063	"This possibility was also ruled out since, although there are few cases of cardiac sarcoidosis without systemic involvement, there were no mediastinal adenopathies, restrictive signs or myocardial thickening to further support this diagnosis.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia399	48	6361	"During admission, the patient remained in sinus rhythm at all times with HR around 60-75 bpm, with increasingly infrequent VT, but even after a week in hospital, there were still bouts of non-sustained monomorphic VT, self-limited almost daily, with a maximum duration of about 20 seconds, with haemodynamic repercussions in some cases, for which reason amiodarone was associated without reducing the number of daily events.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia399	49	6786	In view of this situation, it was decided to ablate the VT substrate.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia399	50	6856	In the electrophysiological study, during radiofrequency application, the VT changes morphology and accelerates to a ventricular flutter that requires an electric shock for its termination.

After discharge, the patient was scheduled for a chest CT angiography and transesophageal echocardiography prior to atrial appendage closure."
casos_clinicos_cardiologia417	66	5207	Both tests showed the existence of thrombus in the left atrial appendage, a situation that contraindicated its closure.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia417	67	5327	"Therefore, the case was assessed in a medical session (heart team) and it was decided to start anticoagulation with dabigatran 110 mg every 12 hours for 3 months, for resolution of the thrombus and subsequent echocardiographic control.
"

"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia417	71	6205	Subsequent echocardiographic controls showed the Amulet device to be correctly placed and the left atrial appendage to be free of thrombus.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia417	72	6345	Likewise, due to the patient's baseline cardiomyopathy with severe ventricular dysfunction, it was decided to implant an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) for primary prevention.

"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia440	95	8754	"CLINICAL COURSE
After removal of a cardiac pacing device, it is recommended to re-evaluate the need for reimplantation of the same device or another device with greater or lesser functionalities."
casos_clinicos_cardiologia440	96	8950	The challenge in this patient was to define whether she had responded to resynchronisation therapy, to indicate a resynchronising pacemaker again or, if not, a single-chamber pacing pacemaker.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia440	97	9143	The patient was finally considered a clinical responder due to a slight improvement in functional class (NYHA III to II), but not a responder echocardiographically.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia440	98	9308	"Given the positive clinical response, reimplantation of a new cardiac resynchronisation device was indicated.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia440	99	9418	During admission, the cardiac resynchronisation device was initially scheduled to be explanted and removed at the same time, with periprocedural antibiotic treatment, given that the patient remained afebrile, clinically and haemodynamically stable and without elevation of acute phase reactants.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia440	100	9714	However, while awaiting surgery, she developed bacteraemia due to methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, secondary to phlebitis due to infection of a peripheral vein, so antibiotic therapy with vancomycin was started after drawing blood cultures, and withdrawal and reimplantation was indicated in two stages, after antibiotic therapy.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia440	101	10044	During admission, the patient remained afebrile and haemodynamically stable at all times.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia440	102	10134	Since the patient had a high percentage of pacing with a narrow QRS escape ventricular rhythm at 35 bpm, after removal of the resynchronisation system, a transient right jugular pacemaker was implanted while awaiting reimplantation of the permanent pacemaker.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia440	103	10394	While admitted to the hospital ward, she lost capture due to dislocation of the electrode, which caused decompensation of heart failure requiring continuous isoproterenol perfusion and subsequent replacement of the transient pacing lead, with placement of a temporary active fixation electrode.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia440	104	10689	"After the repositioning procedure, she was admitted to the coronary unit, presenting acute pulmonary oedema that responded favourably to diuretic treatment, and she was discharged to the hospital ward in 48-72 hours, where she remained to complete the antibiotic regimen until the reimplantation of the definitive pacemaker.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia440	105	11014	Finally, in a situation of clinical stability and after approximately 2 weeks of antibiotic treatment, with negative blood cultures, she was scheduled for resynchronisation pacemaker implantation.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia440	106	11211	"Unfortunately, the coronary sinus could not be cannulated after multiple attempts, so only one RV electrode connected to a resynchronisation generator was placed on the contralateral side.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia440	107	11400	The patient was discharged home pending completion of intravenous antibiotic therapy.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia440	108	11486	She is currently clinically stable, has not presented decompensation of heart failure and the control echocardiogram shows no worsening of LVEF.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia440	109	11631	"The patient's clinical evolution in the short-medium term is pending re-evaluation, with the aim of considering other therapeutic alternatives should she present poor clinical evolution, such as endocardial left ventricular stimulation, given that she is a patient with an indication for permanent anticoagulation.

Diagnosed with acute pulmonary oedema and acute renal failure, he was initially admitted to the acute cardiac care unit, where respiratory support measures were established with non-invasive mechanical ventilation, with good adaptation and achieving clinical and gasometric improvement two hours after starting treatment."
casos_clinicos_cardiologia445	22	2839	"However, oligoanuria persisted despite the initiation of intravenous diuretic treatment, so renal replacement therapy with haemofiltration was finally chosen, which facilitated water discharge and contributed to the patient's clinical improvement.

We are dealing with a 70-year-old patient with no known drug allergies or toxic habits; no known diabetes mellitus but hypertensive and dyslipidaemic.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia458	2	201	"He has a family history of ischaemic heart disease.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia458	3	253	The patient's cardiological history began in July 2012, when Holter monitoring was requested after presenting symptomatic bradycardia that required chronotropic drugs during arthroscopy.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia458	4	440	"The 24-hour recording showed spells of atrial fibrillation with MVF 100 bpm (max 150) alternating with the patient's baseline rhythm which was sinus bradycardia (45 bpm).
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia458	5	611	An echocardiographic study was completed, with no abnormalities.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia458	6	676	In November 2012, a bicameral pacemaker was implanted via the subclavian artery and anticoagulation with acenocoumarol was started.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia458	7	808	"Due to persistent atrial fibrillation with poor clinical control, electrical cardioversion was performed and she was discharged with amiodarone 200 mg/24 h and bisoprolol 2.5 mg/24 h, in addition to anticoagulation.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia458	8	1024	In January 2014, he was referred to the outpatient cardiology department for dyspnoea and chest tightness related to exertion of 2 months' duration.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia458	9	1173	"An echocardiogram was performed showing LV with moderately depressed EF. Depletive treatment was started (furosemide and eplerenone) and an analytical study and coronary angiography were requested.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia458	11	1642	The intervention was performed in September 2014, with triple coronary puncture to the middle LAD with internal mammary artery (IMA) and sequence with saphenous vein (SVF) to 1st OM and posterolateral branches.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia458	12	1853	Postoperative evolution was torpid with multiple admissions for dyspnoea and cardiac decompensation.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia458	13	1954	SPECT was performed and showed mild lateral ischaemia, so a new coronary angiography was requested, showing patency of all bypasses performed.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia458	14	2097	The MCP was reviewed, revealing MCP dysfunction, which was corrected by modifying the programming.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia458	15	2196	"Since then, asymptomatic in functional class II. Treatment with amiodarone was withdrawn and replaced with dronedarone due to hypothyroidism.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia458	16	2338	He repeatedly consulted for muscle pain related to statins (simvastatin 10 mg and atorvastatin 10 mg), for which he was referred to the Lipidology unit of reference, despite which the myalgias always recurred with the reintroduction of statins.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia458	17	2583	"Finally, given the high cardiovascular risk, intolerance to lipid-lowering drugs and severe dyslipidaemia, treatment with IPCSK9 was started with good tolerance and LDL levels were reduced to 88 mg/dl from an initial level of 218 mg/dl.

The patient is an 85-year-old woman, with a biological aortic valve prosthesis and double coronary artery bypass grafting who was admitted with acute pulmonary oedema and severe aortic insufficiency was detected on echocardiography due to rupture of one of the leaflets of the biological aortic prosthesis."
casos_clinicos_cardiologia477	67	5129	The patient was admitted in severe heart failure, requiring high doses of intravenous diuretics.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia477	68	5226	"After clinical stabilisation, a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed which confirmed the rupture of one of the aortic prosthesis leaflets, resulting in very severe aortic insufficiency.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia477	69	5420	Given the severity of the valve disease, the case was presented at a medical-surgical session.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia477	70	5515	"Given the patient's advanced age and previous cardiac surgery in 2001, it was decided to implant an aortic valve prosthesis inside the previously implanted prosthesis, percutaneously from femoral access (TAVI valve in valve).

casos_clinicos_cardiologia487	2	51	The patient is a 48-year-old male, dyslipidaemic, with non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy with severe ventricular dysfunction known since 2010.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia487	3	197	Years earlier, a genetic study had been performed, with the finding of an LMNA variant of uncertain significance in a gene related to laminopathy, consistent with the patient's phenotype: non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy associated with conduction disorder and ventricular arrhythmias, which had required multiple ablation procedures in the course of his disease.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia487	4	565	"In addition, the patient had had a mechanical prosthesis ATS no. 25 since 2012 for a bicuspid aortic valve with severe insufficiency.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia487	5	699	During 2016, the patient was in advanced heart failure, in NYHA functional class IV, with severe LV systolic dysfunction on echocardiography requiring repeated admissions for severe decompensation.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia487	6	897	He was therefore included on the elective list for heart transplantation (INTERMACS 4).
casos_clinicos_cardiologia487	7	985	In the following weeks he presented progressive worsening despite periodic cycles of levosimendan, with increasingly frequent decompensations due to low output and congestion, the last of which did not improve despite inotropic support (INTERMACS 2).
casos_clinicos_cardiologia487	8	1236	"It was decided to implant a balloon counterpulsation device and to place him on urgent cardiac transplant list 1.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia487	9	1350	Three weeks later, heart transplantation was performed by bicave technique, with good biventricular function at pump output.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia487	10	1475	"Immediate postoperative period without complications: little need for haemodynamic support, no rhythm disorders, extubation in the first twelve hours, no neurological deficit.
"

"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia500	24	3062	Three days after admission, the patient presented AF-RVR again with haemodynamic instability and respiratory failure secondary to pulmonary oedema, so she was transferred to the Coronary Unit and electrical cardioversion was performed, which was ineffective after several attempts at maximum energy.

"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia502	9	780	Laboratory tests showed no significant alterations.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia502	10	832	A CT scan of the brain showed no ischaemic lesions at that time and she was finally admitted to the Neurology Department with a diagnosis of transient ischaemic attack dependent on the middle cerebral artery.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia502	11	1041	She had a very satisfactory evolution with a control CT scan showing a small ischaemic spot in the right parietal area, suggesting a cardioembolic cause.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia502	12	1195	Since the risk of haemorrhagic transformation was low, it was decided to start anticoagulant treatment with acenocoumarol.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia502	13	1318	As part of the cardioembolic source study, echocardiography was performed.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia502	14	1393	The study was performed in AF with very rapid ventricular response, showing the difficulty to control the rate with beta-blocker therapy.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia502	15	1531	A large mass (99 mm x 71 mm) dilating the left atrium was observed.

Given the situation of respiratory compromise, the patient was transferred to the Acute Cardiac Care Unit, initiating non-invasive ventilatory support with Bi-PAP, intravenous diuretic and frequency control strategy with intravenous digitalisation, with suboptimal control despite blood digoxin levels in the high range of the safety margin, so intravenous amiodarone and beta-blockers at low doses were added to the treatment after a decrease in congestive signs."
casos_clinicos_cardiologia511	39	3971	Heart rate control was achieved, but the patient remained in atrial flutter with a ventricular response of around 85 bpm.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia511	40	4093	An echocardiogram was performed after initial heart rate control, which yielded the results that can be seen in the complementary tests.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia511	41	4230	In summary, severe biventricular dysfunction was observed with evidence of right congestion, with normofunctioning mechanical prostheses.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia511	43	4407	In view of these findings, coronary angiography was performed, ruling out significant coronary artery disease, and global heart failure with biventricular dysfunction secondary to tachycardiomyopathy was postulated as the first diagnosis.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia511	45	4783	Intravenous amiodarone was withdrawn and oral impregnation was maintained, beta-blockers were progressively titrated up to a maximum dose of 10 mg per day and oral digoxin was maintained, with good control.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia511	46	4990	Spironolactone 25 mg per day and furosemide 40 mg in the morning were added to the treatment, maintaining enalapril 5 mg every 12 hours, acenocoumarol and the rest of his usual medication.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia511	47	5179	Finally, after discussing the case with electrophysiology, considering a complex approach for ablation of atypical flutter substrate requiring left access, an endovascular electrophysiological study was rejected and unsuccessful electrical cardioversion was scheduled after the application of 3 shocks.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia511	48	5482	In euvolemic and stable condition, in atypical flutter with controlled ventricular response, she was discharged and referred for follow-up in the Cardiology Day Hospital and heart failure consultation.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia511	49	5684	Subsequent follow-up in the Cardiology day hospital showed the patient to be stable, in functional class II with no evidence of heart failure decompensation.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia511	52	6100	He was again admitted to the Acute Cardiac Care Unit, where non-invasive ventilation, intravenous furosemide and perfused amiodarone were started again, maintaining beta-blockers and digoxin, with a progressively favourable evolution, although it was impossible to control the heart rate, maintaining symptoms and semiology of decompensated heart failure.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia511	53	6456	Considering the patient's tachycardiomyopathy, with severe biventricular dysfunction, and after ruling out another flutter substrate approach due to the need for left access with potential associated complications in an anticoagulated patient, the Heart Team decided to implant a pacemaker-cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CCP-CRT) in the first stage and later ablation of the atrioventricular node.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia511	54	6858	Thus, during admission, endocavitary left cephalic endocardial CRT-PCM was successfully implanted, which allowed subsequent titration of bisoprolol up to supramax doses of 20 mg per day with very good tolerance, achieving good heart rate control and resolution of acute heart failure.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia511	55	7143	Finally, he was discharged in stable, euvolemic condition, maintaining treatment with furosemide 40 mg per day, acenocoumarol 3 mg per day, spironolactone 25 mg per day, enalapril 5 mg every 12 hours, and bisoprolol 10 mg every 12 hours.

A 32-year-old woman with a diagnosis of restrictive cardiomyopathy was admitted due to worsening heart failure despite outpatient intensification of diuretics."
casos_clinicos_cardiologia534	114	6247	During admission, a new echocardiogram was performed, which showed data compatible with myocardial restriction, although with signs suggestive of a constrictive component.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia534	115	6419	To better characterise the restrictive and constrictive components, a CT scan and cardiac MRI were performed, which showed intense calcification of the pericardium, especially at the RV level with myocardial infiltration at that level, and preserved biventricular function without pathological enhancements.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia534	116	6727	The diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis was therefore confirmed, probably in relation to the history of acute myopericarditis in adolescence.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia534	119	7266	The catheterisation data suggested a predominance of myocardial restriction, but given the findings in the imaging tests, it was decided to present the patient for a medical-surgical session to consider pericardiectomy, which was finally rejected due to intense intramyocardial calcification, anatomically limiting the possibilities of a complete pericardial resection surgery.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia534	120	7644	Given the poor clinical evolution with the need for increased diuretics and the impossibility of pericardiectomy, it was decided to refer the patient to a heart transplant centre.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia543	45	4107	At this point, the clinical evolution during admission and test findings suggest CHF with preserved ejection fraction, with AF with rapid MVR and diastolic dysfunction.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia543	46	4276	Diuretic treatment was intensified and MRI with gadolinium was requested to continue the study, given the suspicion of cardiomyopathy, in which normal-sized left ventricle with asymmetric thickening of predominantly septal in the middle and apical segments, with heterogeneous late enhancement, transmural in the inferior wall and in the subendocardial location in the anterior wall, suggestive of amyloidosis, was reported.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia543	47	4701	In view of these results, myocardial scintigraphy with 99mTc-HDMP was requested, and the findings were consistent with the diagnosis of ATTR type cardiac amyloidosis.

On re-admission he was desaturated, with intense respiratory work and mildly obnubilised, so non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) was started with a very good initial response and perfusion of furosemide."
casos_clinicos_cardiologia546	79	9732	After clinical and blood pressure stabilisation, a new echocardiogram was performed which showed normalisation of the previously described alterations in segmental contractility and a decrease in the degree of mitral regurgitation to mild.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia546	80	9972	Due to suspicion of acute mitral insufficiency (echocardiography in 2019 did not reveal mitral insufficiency) in the context of ischaemia due to high blood pressure, coronary angiography was performed, revealing in-stent restenosis in the circumflex ostium, which was treated with a new drug-eluting stent.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia546	81	10279	Control tests showed recovery of renal function to baseline and correction of initial mild hyperkalaemia to mild hypokalaemia, requiring supplementary potassium, and a red blood cell concentrate due to anaemia without active bleeding.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia546	82	10514	The patient continued to progress favourably until transferred to a conventional hospital ward and was subsequently discharged home.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia546	83	10647	In a patient with high ischaemic risk (cardiovascular risk factors, chronic ischaemic heart disease and previous peripheral artery disease and in-stent restenosis) and high haemorrhagic risk (normocytic-normochromic anaemia due to digestive losses, bladder tumour under follow-up, poorly controlled hypertension at home and chronic kidney disease), double therapy was prescribed with apixaban 5 mg every 12 hours and clopidogrel 75 mg daily; triple therapy was used during hospitalisation.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia546	84	11137	The change from edoxaban to apixaban is due to the consideration of the European guidelines for atrial fibrillation of the use of apixaban or dabigatran 110 mg due to the lower rate of gastrointestinal bleeding compared to warfarin.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia546	85	11370	As an obese patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus under suboptimal treatment with HbA1c of 7.4%, semaglutide 0.25 mg weekly subcutaneously is started for 4 weeks with a view to increasing to 0.5 and 1 mg thereafter.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia548	48	4315	"CLINICAL EVOLUTION
Given the high suspicion of acute coronary syndrome with ST-segment elevation Killip-Kimball IV, the infarction code was activated and a central venous line was channelled for the infusion of vasoactive drugs prior to transfer to the haemodynamics room (dobutamine and noradrenaline)."
casos_clinicos_cardiologia548	49	4619	During the transfer he presented cardiorespiratory arrest in ventricular fibrillation, so advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation manoeuvres were started, and he recovered a pulse after defibrillation at 200J.

In the coronary unit, amiodarone perfusion and oxygen therapy with high-flow glasses was started, achieving clinical stabilisation in the first 24 hours, with reversion of flutter to sinus rhythm at 90 bpm, negative balances of almost 3 litres and marked clinical improvement."
casos_clinicos_cardiologia554	115	8778	The first echocardiography and coronary angiography were performed.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia554	116	8846	In view of the catheterisation findings, an assessment was requested from the internal medicine department with the suspicion of a vasculitic condition as the cause of the coronary lesions.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia554	117	9036	That same day, treatment was started with corticosteroid boluses, oral prednisone and later methotrexate as an immunosuppressant.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia554	118	9166	From the clinical point of view, the patient was admitted for a very long time, with a hospital stay of almost 40 days.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia554	119	9286	Cardiologically, the patient showed a rapid and favourable evolution during the first week and was discharged to the conventional hospital ward.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia554	120	9431	However, on the seventh day of admission (after the PET scan), he presented an arrhythmic storm with three episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia that required electrical cardioversion and multiple non-sustained episodes.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia554	121	9660	For this reason, he had to be transferred again to the coronary unit and was started on lidocaine perfusion, midazolam and beta-blocker with a good response.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia554	122	9818	He did not suffer any more arrhythmic events and presented a slow but adequate evolution of his heart failure.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia554	123	9929	During the second week, the patient suffered a paralytic ileus, with suspicion of associated cecal volvulus (which was the reason for requesting an abdominal CT scan and colonoscopy) which improved with digestive rest, nasogastric tube and antibiotic treatment without the need for surgery.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia554	124	10220	Lastly, it should be mentioned that on admission the patient had very severe skin involvement, with erythroderma secondary to his psoriasis, as well as involvement of the hands and feet with signs of poor perfusion that slowly improved with medical treatment.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia554	125	10480	As for the aetiological diagnosis, computed tomography angiography showed lesions suspicious of vasculitis in the visceral arteries and in both iliac arteries without involvement of the supra-aortic trunks.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia554	126	10687	The complete blood test showed a rather anodyne result with elevation of several non-specific inflammatory markers (CRP, ferritin, complement, IL-6...) but with negative results in the key tests (ENA, ANCA, cryoglobulins, antiphospholipid antibodies, HBV, HCV and HIV serology...).
casos_clinicos_cardiologia554	127	10969	In view of the results, PET-CT was ordered in the hope of confirming inflammation data at the vascular level to support the presumptive diagnosis (at that time Takayasu-type large vessel vasculitis was the main candidate).
casos_clinicos_cardiologia554	128	11192	However, the absence of uptake in the supra-aortic trunks ruled out this pathology.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia554	129	11276	Following this setback, multiple diagnostic studies were requested with the intention of confirming medium-vessel vasculitis (mainly polyarteritis nodosa, PAN).
casos_clinicos_cardiologia554	130	11437	A skin, subcutaneous tissue and nerve biopsy was performed, as well as an electromyogram/electroneurogram.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia554	131	11544	It is worth mentioning that the initial intention was to perform a direct arterial biopsy of the iliac/femoral territory (a territory known to be affected by the scan data).
casos_clinicos_cardiologia554	132	11718	However, this option was discarded following vascular surgery assessment which considered, given the calibre of the vessels involved, that the risk of complications (ischaemia and/or haemorrhage) was too high.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia554	133	11928	The biopsy found no data suggestive of vasculitis, but the electromyogram showed a pattern of mononeuritis multiplex, very typical of PAN.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia554	134	12067	The clinical course was favourable and he was discharged after implantation of an automatic defibrillator (ICD) for secondary prevention.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia554	135	12205	As for the diagnosis, it was concluded (given the vascular involvement, the multiple mononeuritis and the improvement with anti-inflammatory drugs) that the most likely cause of the patient's clinical picture was polyarteritis nodosa.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia554	136	12440	However, given the multiple cardiovascular risk factors (including cocaine use), early atherosclerosis was always considered as a possible alternative.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia554	137	12592	"She was discharged with immunosuppressive and steroid treatment, oral anticoagulation, acetylsalicylic acid, statins and full medical treatment of heart failure, to continue outpatient follow-up in the advanced heart failure unit.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia561	33	3903	A blood test was performed one month later, which showed serum potassaemia of 4.1 mEq/l, so it was decided to increase the dose of ARA-II (candesartan 8 mg every 24 hours).
casos_clinicos_cardiologia561	34	4076	On review in consultation (November 2019), the patient reported improvement in his functional class to NYHA II/IV, with potassium levels remaining in the normal range.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia561	35	4244	"Given the good tolerance, it was decided to change to sacubitril/valsartan at low doses (24/26 mg every 12 hours), with which the improvement in functional class progressed to NYHA I/IV (December 2019): the patient reported that he could walk 2-4 km on level ground, as well as climb slopes and several flights of stairs without having to stop.

"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia561	36	4590	As serum potassaemia remains in range, a mineralcorticoid receptor antagonist (low-dose spironolactone) is started.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia561	37	4706	At the next check-up, a new blood test showed slight hyperkalaemia (5.58 mEq/l), so it was decided to increase the dose of patiromer to two sachets (16.8 g) per day.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia561	38	4872	With this, serum portasium levels were again normalised; at this time (February 2020) the patient was taking sacubitril/valsartan 24/26 mg every 12 hours and spironolactone 25 mg every 24 hours, and it was decided to maintain this treatment unchanged.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia561	39	5124	Due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, he was seen again in September 2020, when he presented serum potassaemia of 6.30 mEq/l, so the patiromer was titrated up to the maximum dose (25.2 g every 24 hours) and the dose of spironolactone was reduced to 12.5 mg every 24 hours.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia561	40	5391	Three months later, potassium levels were at the upper limit of normal (5.19 mEq/l), so the same treatment was maintained.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia561	41	5514	In January 2021, a control transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, showing an increase in LVEF to 35% and a clear improvement in adverse remodelling with a decrease in ventricular volumes, as well as normalisation of right ventricular function, with the prostheses remaining normal.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia561	42	5801	"The patient remains in good functional class (NYHA I-II/IV), and analytically there was a clear decrease in NT-proBNP during follow-up, with no notable adverse effects.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia562	68	5970	Using the navigation system and traversing a large number of points of the atrial wall with the catheter, a reproduction of the volume and geometry of the left atrium is obtained, representing it in three-dimensional form on a computer application that allows virtual mobility of the established geometry in all directions of space.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia562	69	6303	A cartography map of the pulmonary veins is also drawn up using the same technique described above and labelled, establishing the existence of 4 pulmonary veins (2 left and 2 right).

casos_clinicos_cardiologia562	73	6832	A protocol was initiated to assess atrial fibrillation triggers not originating from pulmonary veins by infusion of isoproterenol at increasing doses until reaching 20 mcg/kg.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia562	74	7008	Under this perfusion, frequent extrasystolic activity and small spurts of AT began, mapping early extrasystolic activity as a possible trigger of atrial fibrillation from the posterior roof of the left atrium and superior vena cava, where even an initiation of AF was recorded without catheter contact with the venous wall.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia562	75	7332	Ablation procedure (temperature controlled up to 43 oC and 30W power).
casos_clinicos_cardiologia562	76	7403	An LSI of 5 in posterior zones and 5.5 in anterior zones is limited.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia562	77	7472	Two radiofrequency applications are performed in the posterosuperior region (better pace and map with a venous-atrial conduction time of 50 ms achieving bidirectional isolation in VPSI).
casos_clinicos_cardiologia562	78	7659	Two lines of applications are performed, delimiting a box in the posterior roof, encompassing the focus of the left atrial roof that could not be delimited in its exact location, joining antral ablation lines of previous pulmonary veins that presented conduction block.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia562	79	7929	A total of 21 applications were made between the two lines.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia562	80	7989	Subsequently, electrical isolation was checked by blocking the outflow of this region.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia562	81	8076	Next, in AD, a crown of applications is formed encompassing the superior vena cava, with a total of 27 applications (714 seconds).
casos_clinicos_cardiologia562	82	8207	In applications of the external face of this venous antrum, stimulation is performed at maximum output prior to applications to ensure the absence of phrenic capture and minimise the risk of phrenic paralysis.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia562	83	8417	Effective isolation of the vein is achieved after the last few applications inside the ablation line, in the area of greatest premature extrasystoles.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia562	84	8568	Verification: after 30 minutes of waiting, isolation and blockage verification manoeuvres carried out previously are repeated, verifying the absence of acute reconnection and persistence of conduction blockage of previous isolation lines.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia562	85	8807	By administering i.v. adenosine (12 mg), the absence of dormant conduction in the pulmonary veins and superior vena cava is verified.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia562	86	8941	"The catheters are removed, normal contractility of the cardiac silhouette is checked and the procedure is concluded.

"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia562	87	9059	"CLINICAL EVOLUTION
In the consultation for review of the results, the patient showed increasingly frequent and long-lasting ECG recordings in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response."
casos_clinicos_cardiologia562	88	9254	The echocardiogram showed moderate systolic dysfunction due to diffuse involvement, but no segmental alterations in contractility.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia562	89	9385	At the time of consultation, he was again in sinus rhythm, but with abundant supraventricular extrasystolic activity.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia562	90	9503	Anticoagulant treatment was started with dabigatran 150 mg/12 h (CHA2DS2VASc score of 3 points (age 1, female 1 and heart failure or reduced LVEF 1 point) and antiarrhythmic treatment with amiodarone 200 mg/24 h, ramipril 2.5 mg/24 h and bisoprolol 2.5 mg/24 h.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia562	91	9765	It was first suspected that the left ventricular dysfunction could be caused by tachycardiomyopathy, and for this reason, together with the presence of symptomatic paroxysms of atrial fibrillation, a new ablation procedure was indicated.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia562	92	10003	However, given the patient's age and history of ex-smoking and slight overweight, assessment of the coronary tree was considered.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia562	93	10133	As the patient required a CT scan of the left atrium and pulmonary veins prior to ablation, this test was used for non-invasive coronary angiography, which showed no significant lesions in the coronary arteries.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia562	94	10345	One month after starting anticoagulation and after discontinuation of antiarrhythmic medication, a second atrial fibrillation ablation procedure was performed.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia562	95	10505	During the procedure, VPSI reconnection was verified, and the VPSI was isolated and checked again.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia562	96	10604	Subsequently, triggers not originating from the pulmonary veins were sought by infusion of isoproterenol, locating a focus in the posterior roof of the left atrium, which was treated by performing a posterior roof box up to the venous antrum and another focus in the superior vena cava, which required circumferential isolation of the same.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia562	97	10945	After the procedure, the patient presented no complications and, given her good evolution, she was discharged from hospital after 24 hours, previously restarting anticoagulant medication and her antiarrhythmic treatment.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia562	98	11166	One month after ablation (still in the blanking period), the patient came for a check-up with evident clinical improvement, being in NYHA functional class I, and with no sensation of tachycardia.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia562	99	11362	She provided ECG recordings which were all in sinus rhythm and in the echocardioscopy performed during the consultation, the LVEF had improved significantly and appeared to be preserved/borderline.

Given the clinical data and initial complementary tests, the probability of ischaemic heart disease was considered low."
casos_clinicos_cardiologia563	52	4222	However, given the exploratory findings, congenital heart disease was suspected, and the echocardiographic study showed an anomalous filling jet in the left atrium.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia563	53	4387	Angio-CT of the coronary arteries was requested, ruling out arteriosclerotic disease, but a fistulous tract of saccular morphology was found between the descending thoracic aorta and the left atrium, with a suspected genetic origin in the absence of surgical history, trauma, or semiology compatible with current or previous endocarditis.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia566	97	8734	A focus of mild glycemic hypermetabolism is observed adjacent to the aortic valve area (SUVmax 2.83), which could be related to known endocarditis (the low degree of uptake could be explained by response to antibiotic treatment).

casos_clinicos_cardiologia566	112	10923	"Good final angiographic result.

"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia566	113	10956	"CLINICAL EVOLUTION
During the first days of admission, a transesophageal echocardiography was performed, as well as a cardiac CT scan, which confirmed the presence of aortic vegetation with involvement of the non-coronary leaflet, with rupture of the same, leading to severe aortic insufficiency."
casos_clinicos_cardiologia566	114	11253	In addition, data suggestive of a previously undescribed vegetation at the mitral level and coronary arteries without lesions were also observed.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia566	115	11399	With these findings, it was decided to discuss the case in a multidisciplinary endocarditis session, with the participation of the radiology, infectious diseases and cardiac surgery departments, with a view to assessing valve replacement.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia566	116	11638	Given the history of splenic infarction, it was decided to request extension studies prior to surgery to rule out embolisms at other levels and to re-evaluate the state of spleen involvement.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia566	117	11830	On the same day, a cranial CT scan was performed which showed the presence of a haemorrhagic lesion in the region of Sylvius compatible with the rupture of a mycotic aneurysm and a PET-CT scan showed marked splenic involvement, with large necrotic areas.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia566	118	12085	At this point, with the presence of valvular involvement, splenomegaly with multiple areas of large infarction, and intracranial bleeding, it was decided jointly with the neurology, cardiac surgery and general surgery services to establish an order of action to treat the set of complications developed by the patient.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia566	119	12404	Initially, an arteriography with embolisation of the mycotic aneurysm affecting the M2 branch of the left middle cerebral artery was performed (after study with cerebral angio-MRI).
casos_clinicos_cardiologia566	120	12586	The procedure was performed without incident and without secondary neurological sequelae.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia566	121	12676	Subsequently, it was decided to perform a splenectomy.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia566	122	12731	The reason for initially resecting the spleen rather than the heart was to avoid the risk of bleeding that could have been caused by the extracorporeal circulation (ECC) and subsequent heparinisation.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia566	123	12932	One week after embolisation, splenectomy by laparotomy was performed without complications.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia566	124	13024	Finally, three days after the splenectomy, the patient underwent surgery for his valve disease.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia566	125	13120	The aortic valve was resected and a St.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia566	126	13160	Jude No. 23 biological prosthesis was implanted.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia566	127	13209	It is noteworthy that during the operation: both the intraoperative TEE and the visual inspection did not reveal the mitral involvement described in the previous report; only a grade II/IV mitral insufficiency, so it was decided not to operate on it (the same grade was maintained at the discharge control).
casos_clinicos_cardiologia566	128	13517	During admission, the patient was treated with intravenous antibiotics according to the recommendations of the infectious diseases department (ceftriaxone, gentamicin and ampicillin).
casos_clinicos_cardiologia566	129	13701	The patient's evolution during the first weeks of admission was acceptably good.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia566	130	13782	The patient remained practically asymptomatic from the cardiological point of view, with development of mild heart failure (but good clinical tolerance) and improvement in both fever and digestive symptoms.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia566	131	13989	The main complications were marked anaemia, which required repeated transfusions of several red blood cell concentrates.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia566	132	14110	On the other hand, he also had a deterioration of renal function that made it necessary to space contrast studies and maintain adequate hydration.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia566	133	14257	After the two surgeries, the patient remained in hospital for a little over a month, with a very poor evolution due to complications derived from his abdominal surgery.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia566	134	14426	This even necessitated reoperation for drainage of the abdominal abscess and the patient's admission to the chronic wound unit for management of the laparotomy incision.

"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia568	76	6357	"CLINICAL COURSE
In the case of a patient with a conduction disorder presenting with exertional dyspnoea and dizziness, it was decided to admit him to cardiology to complete the study."
casos_clinicos_cardiologia568	77	6541	A new exercise stress test was requested to assess the reaction to exercise, and an adequate chronotropic response and 1:1 conduction was observed throughout the test.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia568	78	6709	A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, which ruled out prosthetic dysfunction, without observing segmental contractility alterations suggestive of ischaemia.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia568	79	6874	After the absence of relevant findings in the examinations performed, it was decided to discharge the patient from hospital with withdrawal of beta-blockers.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia568	80	7032	Given the persistence of atypical chest pain with a history of previous coronary artery disease, stress CMR was brought forward with outpatient monitoring in cardiology outpatient clinics.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia568	81	7221	The following week a stress CMR was performed, with negative results for ischaemia, but a periprosthetic collection with contrast uptake was found, of uncertain significance, which could correspond to postoperative inflammatory activity or an infectious process.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia568	82	7484	On assessing the results, taking into account the remoteness of the intervention (> 3 years) and given the possibility of infective prosthetic endocarditis, it was decided to readmit the patient to cardiology to complete the study and start antibiotic treatment.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia568	83	7747	Empirical treatment with ampicillin, cloxacillin and gentamicin was started in agreement with the infectious diseases unit.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia568	84	7871	Blood cultures and serology for endocarditis were requested, with negative results.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia568	85	7955	It was decided to complete the imaging study with PET-CT, which showed the presence of hypermetabolism in the aortic valve prosthesis suggestive of endocarditis, with reactive mediastinal and pulmonary adenopathies; as an incidental finding, a circumferential mural thrombosis of the abdominal aorta and partial obstruction of the right common iliac artery were found.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia568	86	8324	With the above findings, the case was discussed in a joint medical-surgical session between cardiology, cardiac surgery and the infectious diseases unit.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia568	87	8478	Since the patient was stable, with no evidence of prosthetic dysfunction or acute complications, initial antibiotic treatment was chosen for 6 weeks, changing the previous regimen to daptomycin, ceftriaxone and doxycycline, with subsequent re-evaluation.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia568	88	8733	After the first 10 days of treatment, the patient remained clinically stable, and it was decided to discharge him to the home hospitalisation unit (HHU) to complete the antibiotic regimen.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia568	89	8922	Also, with a history of coronary heart disease and the finding of peripheral arterial disease with mural thrombosis of the abdominal aorta, lipid-lowering treatment was intensified with the addition of a combination of atorvastatin/ezetimibe.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia568	90	9165	After 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy, a new control PET-CT scan was performed, in which periprosthetic hypermetabolism persisted but of less intensity than previously, with disappearance of the reactive adenopathies.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia568	91	9381	"With the good response to treatment, it was decided to complete 4 more weeks of antibiotic treatment, replacing doxycycline with rifampicin, which would subsequently be maintained in monotherapy until completing 6 months of treatment.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia571	14	1572	"In week 34 she was referred to the obstetrics emergency department for high blood pressure of 168/84 mmHg: complementary tests showed proteinuria and plateletopenia, so it was decided to admit her for pulmonary maturation and observation on suspicion of possible pre-eclampsia versus alterations secondary to antiphospholipid syndrome.

"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia571	15	1909	Initially, vaginal delivery was attempted (because it was associated with less blood loss and less risk of infection and venous thromboembolism), but due to the risk of loss of foetal well-being, caesarean section was finally indicated.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia571	16	2146	The patient had remained stable from a cardiological point of view during admission, but 12 hours after the caesarean section, cardiology was notified due to desaturation up to 77%.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia571	17	2328	The patient only reported having started, while at rest, with a feeling of warmth and dizziness, without loss of consciousness, clear dyspnoea, orthopnoea or chest pain.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia571	18	2498	Physical examination She was conscious and oriented, well perfused, blood pressure (BP) 160/90 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 75 bpm and oxygen saturation (SO2) 91-92% with oxygen therapy with nasal goggles (NG) at 2 l/min, eupneic at rest and tolerating decubitus.

"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia571	32	4065	"CLINICAL EVOLUTION
After a joint assessment with gynaecology and resuscitation, it was decided to transfer the patient for a computed tomography (CT) scan, which showed extensive bilateral alveolar consolidations and septal thickening affecting both lungs, suggestive of bilateral pneumonia."
casos_clinicos_cardiologia571	33	4357	Mild bilateral pleural effusion.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia571	34	4390	In addition, a small repletion defect was identified in a segmental branch of the left lower lobe, compatible with pulmonary thromboembolism, without overload of the right heart chambers.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia571	35	4578	During the CT scan, the patient presented intense dyspnoea without desaturation, which improved with sitting and increased oxygen therapy.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia571	36	4717	"In view of the findings of the complementary tests, it was decided to admit her to resuscitation for treatment of the suspected bilateral pneumonia, in addition to diuretic treatment to force a negative water balance.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia571	37	4935	During her stay, she had a very good clinical evolution, with very abundant diuresis, resolution of dyspnoea, and improvement in SO2 that allowed her to de-escalate from oxygen therapy with high-flow glasses (HFG) to NG, and later withdrawal of the same, so that the picture was more likely to be one of acute heart failure (HF).
casos_clinicos_cardiologia571	38	5265	The patient was discharged to the obstetrics ward after 48 hours in resuscitation, where she presented a good clinical evolution with resolution of the congestive semiology, and was finally discharged.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia571	39	5467	Since her discharge, the patient has continued to undergo cardiological check-ups, initially more closely, which have been spaced out to be performed every three months.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia571	40	5637	Her blood pressure remains practically normal, and the clinical signs of heart failure have completely resolved: she has no dyspnoea, orthopnoea or oedema, which has allowed complete suspension of the diuretic without the need to reintroduce it.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia571	41	5883	The last echocardiogram showed severe aortic insufficiency with moderate-severe mitral insufficiency and preserved biventricular function.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia571	42	6022	"The decompensation that occurred during the puerperium was interpreted in the context of the haemodynamic changes that occur during pregnancy, so for the time being a wait-and-see attitude is maintained with close clinical and echocardiographic monitoring.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia579	74	6588	"CLINICAL COURSE
The patient was initially seen in the emergency department of our hospital."
casos_clinicos_cardiologia579	75	6680	Given the signs of heart failure predominantly on the right and the central thoracic pain, together with the elevation of acute phase reactants in the laboratory tests, it was decided to admit the patient for further investigation.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia579	76	6912	During her stay in the ED, the patient presented a peak fever of 38.2oC and blood cultures were taken.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia579	77	7015	The echocardiogram on admission showed severe pericardial effusion with signs of echocardiographic repercussions, but no clinical signs at that time.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia579	78	7165	Blood cultures showed growth of SAMS.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia579	79	7203	Suspicion of purulent pericarditis led to subxiphoid pericardial drainage and antibiotic therapy was started with cefazolin and daptomycin.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia579	80	7343	Pericardial fluid cultures were sterile but the biochemical characteristics of the fluid were infectious.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia579	81	7449	The patient's symptoms did not clearly improve despite drainage of the pericardial fluid, so a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was requested to rule out the presence of endocarditis and to evaluate the progression of the effusion.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia579	82	7685	This TEE showed constrictive physiology data suggestive of effusive-constrictive pericarditis.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia579	83	7780	In addition to the cardiorespiratory symptoms, the patient presented pain in the upper lumbar region, both shoulders and left lower extremity.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia579	84	7923	In view of the suspicion of septic foci, the study was completed with thoracoabdominal CT and magnetic resonance imaging of both shoulders and lumbar region.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia579	85	8081	Imaging studies confirmed the presence of septic arthritis in both shoulders, spondylodiscitis at L2-L3 and multiple abscesses in bilateral psoas.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia579	86	8228	"The patient also presented a lesion on the left lower extremity compatible with cellulitis.

"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia579	87	8321	Due to the persistence of fever, despite targeted antibiotherapy, the abscesses in the psoas muscle were drained and SAMS was again isolated in the fluid culture.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia579	88	8484	The control echocardiogram showed slight pericardial effusion with no signs of haemodynamic compromise or constrictive physiology.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia579	89	8615	Slow evolution of the patient, with progressive disappearance of the different infectious foci and clinical improvement without new episodes of fever.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia579	90	8766	Periodic blood cultures were negative.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia579	91	8805	Finally, after 8 weeks of intravenous antibiotics, she was discharged for outpatient follow-up.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia579	92	8901	"Treatment at discharge was omeprazole 20 mg every 24 hours, dexketoprofen 25 mg every 12 hours, colchicine 0.5 mg every 24 hours, paracetamol 1 g every 8 hours and bemiparin 7,500 IU every 24 hours.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia580	30	2747	"CLINICAL EVOLUTION
The patient was admitted to the coronary unit with stable, pain-free condition, with low-dose nitroglycerine perfusion and controlled blood pressure, and early coronary angiography was performed with the findings described."
casos_clinicos_cardiologia580	31	2990	Given the absence of angina and TIMI 3 distal flow, conservative management in the coronary unit was initially decided.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia580	32	3110	In the following days, the patient presented several short episodes of precordial pain lasting a few minutes, with no electrical changes or increase in markers of myocardial damage.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia580	33	3292	On the third day of admission, she presented a new episode of pain of greater intensity, with an electrocardiogram (ECG 3) showing ST-segment elevation >1mm in V1 to V4 and 0.5mm in III and aVF. It was decided to perform a new coronary angiography (video 2.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia580	34	3550	Coronary angiography 2) which showed distal progression of the dissection, with worsening of the lumen of the artery at the medial level and complete collapse of the same in the apical segment, with weak homolateral collaterals (Rentrop 1).
casos_clinicos_cardiologia580	35	3791	Given the haemodynamic stability, the disappearance of pain with electrocardiographic improvement after medical treatment and the location of the occlusion in the distal-apical segment, conservative management was again decided, with good initial evolution and progressive decrease in markers of myocardial damage.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia580	36	4106	Six days later, the patient presented a new episode of intense precordial pain accompanied by haemodynamic deterioration with hypotension (TAS 70 mmHg) requiring vasoactive drugs, respiratory deterioration, radiological worsening compatible with acute pulmonary oedema (chest X-ray) and new elevation of myocardial damage markers from 500 to 3750 pg/ml.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia580	37	4460	The ECG (ECG 4) shows ST-segment elevation > 2 mm in V4-V5 and 0.5 mm in II, III and aVF. It was decided to perform a new coronary angiography (Coronary angiography 3) which showed progression of the dissection at the proximal level, with complete occlusion of the vessel at the middle level and distal vessel weakly visualised by homocoronary collaterals (Rentrop 1).
casos_clinicos_cardiologia580	38	4829	In view of the shock situation and TIMI 0 flow, it was decided to intervene guided by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), and after placing the angioplasty catheter and passing the guidewire to ADA and diagonal, an image of dissection in the distal left coronary artery (possibly facilitated by the tip of the catheter on a susceptible intima) with TIMI 0 flow in all branches was observed.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia580	39	5217	A 3.5 x 28 mm drug-eluting stent was implanted in the coronary trunk to the proximal anterior descending coronary artery and a second 3.5-3.0x60 mm stent was implanted distally, restoring TIMI 3 flow in the distal anterior descending artery although with persistent non-occlusive dissection, and first diagonal with TIMI 1 flow.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia580	40	5546	Finally, conservative management of the circumflex artery ostium was chosen after restoring distal TIMI 3 flow, once the entry port had been sealed.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia580	41	5695	The patient evolved favourably over the following days, with resolution of the shock situation and discharge to the cardiology ward.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia580	42	5828	Regular echocardiography was performed (video 4) and the study was completed with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (video 5), showing dilatation of the left ventricle with severe depression of its systolic function (LVEF 34%) secondary to alterations in segmental contractility in apical segments and on the lateral side, transmural necrosis of 4 segments of the LAD territory (apical segments) and non-transmural necrosis on the lateral side.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia584	71	6243	Given the clinical presentation (no chest pain, no signs of acute ischaemia in the electrocardiogram and no elevation of myocardial damage markers), the presence of severe global ventricular dysfunction that recovered early after control of the arrhythmia was considered as dysfunction secondary to tachycardiomyopathy.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia584	72	6563	Finally, an electrophysiological study was performed which documented, firstly, that it was a ventricular tachycardia (existence of VA dissociation) and subsequently, by means of manoeuvres, that it was a branch-branch ventricular tachycardia (electrogram of the right ventricular apex early on the start of the QRS) and, another fundamental fact, the return cycle was very short (10 ms) after the tachycardia was triggered from the RV apex.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia584	73	7005	Right bundle branch ablation and DDD pacemaker implantation was performed (due to HV lengthening up to 100 ms).

The patient remained stable throughout admission."
casos_clinicos_cardiologia586	81	7680	The case was referred to the endocrinometabolic surgery unit, which decided that the patient was not a candidate for bariatric surgery due to a history of prostatic neoplasia under active treatment (less than 5 years).
casos_clinicos_cardiologia586	82	7899	On discharge, his usual treatment was maintained.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia586	83	7949	"However, given that during admission he was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (HbA1c 6.4%), it was decided to start treatment with semaglutide 0.5 mg, one injection per week for 4 weeks, subsequently increasing to 1 mg per week indefinitely, with good tolerance.

"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia586	84	8212	Treatment was also started with dapagliflozin 10 mg 1 tablet per day and eplerenone 25 mg 1 tablet per day.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia586	85	8320	Education in heart failure is started.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia586	86	8359	Periodic scheduled admissions were decided (the patient lives far from our hospital) for treatment with levosimendan under monitoring.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia586	87	8494	During successive admissions, all of which were uneventful, a gradual weight loss was observed as follows: in June 2020, the patient weighed 107 kg, in July 2020 he weighed 100 kg, and in August 2020 he weighed 94 kg.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia586	88	8712	The patient reports a marked improvement of his functional class, almost NYHA class I. Laboratory tests show a reduction in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) from 6.4% in May to 5.7% at 3 months.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia586	89	8907	On admission in September 2020, the patient weighs 89 kg and in October 2020, the weight is maintained at 89 kg.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia586	90	9020	Subsequent outpatient follow-up is carried out at our hospital.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia586	91	9084	The patient indicates that he has reduced his weight to 84 kg (BMI 28.39 kg/m2, overweight grade 2).
casos_clinicos_cardiologia586	92	9185	He reports some fatigue on exertion, but denies dyspnoea.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia586	93	9243	He is able to climb several floors without stopping.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia586	94	9296	He has stopped taking furosemide tablets.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia586	95	9338	Therefore, and as a summary, since the introduction of antidiabetic treatment (semaglutide 1 mg weekly and dapagliflozin 10 mg daily), the patient has started a progressive and constant weight reduction until reaching a weight of 84 kg, managing to maintain the loss over time.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia586	96	9616	From an initial weight of 112 kg and a BMI of 37.86 kg/m2 (grade 2 obesity), the patient reduced his weight by a total of 28 kg in approximately 6 months, reaching a BMI of 28.39 kg/m2 (grade 2 overweight).

On arrival at the ED, the patient was hypotensive (blood pressure 95/50 mmHg, heart rate 80 bpm), saturating at 97% with nasal spectacles at 2 litres/minute and with persistent chest pain."
casos_clinicos_cardiologia590	72	5860	Urgent echocardiography showed moderate to severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction and segmental alterations, and the patient was transferred to the haemodynamics department for urgent coronary angiography.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia590	73	6072	The coronary angiography showed significant stenosis of the left main coronary artery due to a probable haematoma causing extrinsic compression, with no significant angiographic lesions in the rest of the coronary tree.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia590	74	6292	Before proceeding to revascularisation, acute aortic syndrome was ruled out by urgent aortic CT angiography.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia590	75	6401	After this, percutaneous revascularisation was chosen, so coronary angiography was repeated in the following hours and a stent was implanted in the left coronary artery towards the anterior descending coronary artery with good angiographic results.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia590	76	6650	During the procedure, he presented hypotension and sinus tachycardia requiring continuous perfusion of noradrenaline (0.31 microg/kg/minute).
casos_clinicos_cardiologia590	77	6792	She returned to the coronary unit asymptomatic, maintaining the noradrenaline perfusion which could be progressively withdrawn in the first 48 hours after revascularisation.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia590	78	6966	After a favourable evolution, he was transferred to the hospital ward.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia590	79	7037	Initially, double antiplatelet therapy was maintained with ASA 100 mg and clopidogrel 75 mg; however, given the high thrombotic risk due to stenting in the left coronary trunk, it was decided to switch to ticagrelor 48 hours after catheterisation.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia590	80	7285	In the post-revascularisation echocardiographic control, severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction persisted, so treatment for heart failure was started with good tolerance, presenting mild ventricular dysfunction at hospital discharge.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia590	81	7525	After hospital discharge, she was included in the cardiac rehabilitation programme, which she completed without incident.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia590	82	7647	She is currently being monitored in cardiology consultations and has remained asymptomatic from the cardiovascular point of view.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia590	83	7777	Follow-up echocardiography showed that left ventricular systolic function had recovered and was preserved one year after the event.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia598	25	2830	The cecal appendix showed minimal enlargement of its base, probably secondary to the described inflammatory changes and the proximity to the ileum.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia598	26	2978	Distally the appendix was of normal calibre.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia598	27	3023	Therefore, these findings were more suggestive of ileitis with associated inflammatory changes (slightly affecting the base of the appendix) than appendicitis.

A new PCR was performed 48 hours after admission, which was negative, and COVID isolation was lifted."
casos_clinicos_cardiologia598	57	5541	Subsequently, serology was performed with positive IgG for SARS-CoV-2.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia598	58	5612	Seventy-two hours after admission, she began to experience repeated episodes of central thoracic pain described as stabbing, radiating to the neck, which increased with deep inspiration.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia598	59	5799	They were accompanied by sweating and, on occasion, vomiting.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia598	60	5861	Following the findings described in the complementary tests (analysis with elevated acute phase reactants and markers of myocardial damage, electrocardiogram with sinus tachycardia and echocardiogram with global hypokinesia), treatment was started with beta-blockers and he was transferred to the coronary unit where he was monitored without arrhythmic events of interest.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia598	61	6234	After 48 hours he was transferred to the cardiology hospital ward to complete the study and treatment.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia598	62	6337	During his stay on the ward he remained asymptomatic, with no evidence of heart failure.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia598	63	6426	Treatment was started with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and beta-blockers.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia598	64	6530	A repeat echocardiogram showed normalisation of systolic function, although slight hypokinesia persisted in the basal segments of the septum and anterolateral face.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia598	65	6695	The control electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm alternating with bouts of nodal rhythm without relevant clinical translation (he did not present syncope or other alarm symptoms), so the beta-blockers were discontinued and he was monitored with telemetry and these episodes were observed during sleep, which could be secondary to vagal hypotonia or be in the context of the evolution of myocarditis.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia598	66	7096	From the digestive point of view, he presented significant clinical improvement, without pain and with normalisation of intestinal transit.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia598	67	7236	He completed empirical antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone and metronidazole, started on admission.

"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia60	5	416	In 1978 he underwent mitral and aortic valve replacement with biological prostheses.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia60	6	501	In 1990, both prostheses malfunctioned, so a new replacement with two mechanical prostheses was performed.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia60	7	608	The aortic prosthesis was implanted at the level of the coronary ostium, so it was necessary to perform two aortocoronary grafts (saphenous vein to the anterior interventricular and right coronary artery).
casos_clinicos_cardiologia60	8	814	In 2002 he was admitted for heart failure and haemolytic anaemia related to late periprosthetic dehiscence, so a new mitral valve replacement was performed with another mechanical prosthesis and new aortocoronary grafts (saphenous vein to the middle anterior descending artery and to the right coronary artery).
casos_clinicos_cardiologia60	9	1126	In 2003, DDD pacemaker implantation was performed due to symptomatic sinus node disease with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia60	13	1463	"A control transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed, followed by a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) which confirmed the presence of two mitral periprosthetic leaks (one septal and one posterior).
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia60	14	1670	Taking into account the patient's morbidity and the high surgical risk, the patient was scheduled for percutaneous leak closure.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia60	15	1799	"This procedure was performed on 08/01/2015 under general anaesthesia and with transesophageal echocardiography control in the haemodynamics room.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia60	16	1945	Initial access was via the right femoral vein and, after transseptal puncture, an attempt was made to cross the posterior mitral leak (as it was the largest) in an antegrade manner, without success.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia60	17	2144	Therefore, it was decided to puncture the left femoral artery and cross the mechanical aortic prosthesis with a guide and a catheter with good haemodynamic tolerance.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia60	18	2311	The posterior leak is crossed and the guidewire is captured in the left atrium (LA) with a loop, externalising via the right femoral vein, thus creating an arteriovenous (AV) shunt.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia60	19	2493	The size of the defect by 3D TEE is 10x4 mm, so a 10x5mm Vascular Plug device is chosen for closure.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia60	20	2594	A release sheath is advanced from the right femoral vein through the defect into the left ventricle (LV) and the device is released from the LV to the LA with good placement and effective closure of the defect (video 3 and figure 1).
casos_clinicos_cardiologia60	21	2828	The procedure is completed and the left femoral artery puncture is closed with good results.

Given the chest pain with elevated troponin T hs and semiological data compatible with decompensation of heart failure, depletive treatment with intravenous furosemide was started in the emergency department, obtaining a favourable response and subsequently allowing the patient to be started on drugs for ventricular dysfunction."
casos_clinicos_cardiologia600	44	5813	On the other hand, in view of the patient's tachycardia, the pacemaker was interrogated, confirming a pacemaker-mediated tachycardia, which was resolved after extending the post-ventricular atrial refractory period.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia600	47	6553	In addition, the tricuspid valve exhibited mild insufficiency allowing an estimated pulmonary arterial systolic pressure of 63 mmHg.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia600	48	6686	Given the previous findings, coronary angiography was performed and showed non-significant coronary lesions.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia600	49	6795	The case was discussed in a medical-surgical session and transcatheter valve implantation via the femoral artery (TAVI) was chosen.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia600	50	6927	In addition, the possibility of urgent percutaneous valvotomy was considered if the patient's situation required it at some point during admission.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia63	82	8548	"The following morning, DDDR definitive MCP was implanted, being in MCP rhythm on command and with no new pathological findings on monitoring, but BP 160/95 persisted despite treatment with amlodipine 10 mg/12h and doxazosin 8 mg/24h in a patient with no known chronic hypertension and with elevated renal function figures since admission.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia63	83	8887	On the afternoon of the implant, the patient began sudden dyspnoea with BP 220/130 in a situation of radiological APE with bilateral pleural effusion, respiratory acidosis with global respiratory failure requiring the start of non-invasive ventilation with BIPAP, intensive diuretic treatment, intravenous nitrates and combination with full-dose antihypertensive drugs (amlodipine, doxazosin); ACE inhibitors were not started due to renal dysfunction.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia63	84	9339	A new emergent TTE was performed, which showed the previous findings.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia63	85	9409	After 8 hours of treatment, there was a clear clinical, radiological and blood gas improvement, so non-invasive ventilation was withdrawn and diuretic treatment was reduced; however, persistently high BP levels persisted despite high-dose IV NTG and full doses of amlodipine and doxazosin; and the deterioration of renal function with proteinuria and haematuria was increasing, although with negative balances, accompanied by plateletopenia and anaemia with reticulocytosis.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia63	86	9884	"Again 72 hours after the episode of PAD, he suffered a new crisis of dyspnoea accompanied by a hypertensive crisis with figures of 190/100 with worsening renal function and oliguria.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia63	87	10067	At this point, taking into account the patient's history and the complementary tests (see section on complementary tests), a presumptive diagnosis was made, which was later confirmed with definitive diagnostic tests.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia63	88	10284	Specific treatment was prescribed, with improvement of the respiratory symptoms and control of BP levels.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia63	89	10390	However, the deterioration of renal function was persistent and progressive, requiring a right femoral catheter for haemodialysis.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia63	90	10521	Subsequently, a renal biopsy was performed which revealed tubulointerstitial nephropathy and vascular involvement that led to stage V renal disease with the need for renal replacement therapy.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia63	91	10714	A right jugular tunnelled catheter was placed and the patient was discharged home (day 58 since admission) on an outpatient chronic haemodialysis programme.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia78	37	2827	We started treatment with bisoprolol 2.5 mg daily, which we had to discontinue due to intense asthenia.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia78	38	2931	We replaced bisoprolol with olmesartan 10 mg daily with good tolerance and good control.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia78	39	3020	Studies for secondary causes were negative.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia78	40	3064	Cardiac MRI was requested where a restrictive pattern was observed as described in the complementary tests (MRI 1).
casos_clinicos_cardiologia78	41	3180	In the control cardiac MRI (MRI 2) performed at 12 months, we detected images of crescentic morphology at the level of the apex.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia78	42	3309	The images offer a reasonable doubt between laminar thrombi at the apical level versus artefacts.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia78	43	3407	In favour of thrombi is the fact that they are located over the areas of fibrosis detected in the MRI and the high thrombogenicity of this disease, although the fact that they appear in both ventricles suggests that it could also be an artefact.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia78	44	3653	Echocardiography showed no evidence of intracavitary thrombus.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia78	45	3716	We explained the situation to the patient and decided to start anticoagulation with sintrom, which we again had to suspend due to intense asthenia and osteomuscular pain.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia78	46	3887	We raised the possibility of starting treatment with rivaroxaban 20 mg daily, for off-label use.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia78	47	3984	After explaining to the patient that this is not an indication studied in clinical trials or approved by the Ministry, we decided to treat the patient jointly; in the controls he presented good tolerance and disappearance of the symptoms attributed to the synthroid.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia78	48	4251	In the control MRI (MRI 3), after 3 months of anticoagulation, the same images continue to appear, which are not present in the echocardiography.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia78	49	4397	"However, given that thrombotic phenomena appear in up to 25% of cases and that the current indications for anticoagulation contemplate starting treatment when thrombosis has already occurred, we decided to maintain treatment, even with an off-label drug.

casos_clinicos_cardiologia81	34	1902	Dilatation and moderate biventricular dysfunction were observed.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia81	35	1967	When ischaemic origin was ruled out by coronary angiography, it was attributed as possibly secondary to tachycardiomyopathy or alcohol-induced cardiomyopathy.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia81	36	2126	During admission, telemetry showed a spontaneous pause of 12 seconds coinciding with sleep apnoea, leaving the patient's own rhythm with narrow QRS.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia81	37	2275	The patient was questioned about sleep habits and, with a high suspicion of sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome (SAOS), a consultation with Pneumology was requested.

The patient was assessed in the emergency department and was found to have acute pulmonary oedema with haemodynamic stability initially."
casos_clinicos_cardiologia82	62	3949	Echocardioscopy performed in the emergency department revealed severe mitral insufficiency due to posterior mitral prolapse and possible rupture of the chordae tendineae, so it was decided to transfer her to the coronary care unit, while Cardiac Surgery on duty was contacted to assess urgent surgery, and the haemodynamicist on duty to perform coronary angiography, with the findings described above.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia82	63	4351	On arrival at the coronary unit, oxygen therapy was administered with 100% oxygen reservoir, intravenous diuretic and low-dose ACE inhibitors, despite which he continued to worsen both from the respiratory and haemodynamic point of view, and was admitted to the operating theatre as an emergency patient.

"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia83	49	4628	Diuretic treatment and poor tolerance to vasodilator and beta-blocker treatment, so initial management was restricted to intravenous diuretic infusion with oral potassium and oral ACE inhibitors, as well as anticoagulation.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia83	50	4852	"The patient had symptoms of dizziness and significant asthenia, which made it necessary to start beta-blockers progressively, starting with minimal doses, and finally achieving good tolerance.
"
casos_clinicos_cardiologia83	51	5045	She presented several episodes of atrial fibrillation with ventricular response at 170 bpm symptomatic with clinical dyspnoea and non-specific dizziness, but with good haemodynamic response, which meant that, given the poor initial tolerance of the beta-blockers, digoxin had to be associated, despite the renal failure, with correct control of renal function, which did not worsen.
casos_clinicos_cardiologia83	52	5428	Finally, significant improvement in congestive symptoms was achieved with diuretics, heart rate control with digoxin and beta-blockers, as well as control of blood pressure.
